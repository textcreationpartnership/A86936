            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:114928:3"/>
Patronage of ſo many Reverend, and Learned men; Yet the reaſons that have moved me to preſent it firſt unto you, and under your name to the view of the world, have been ſo preſſing upon me, that I could not incline to make any other choice. One of you was the firſt mover and ſolicitour of me to any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of this kinde, when I little dream'd of ſuch a matter, and hath continued a conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of me in going about it. Others of you have been particularly aſſiſtant and very refreſhful unto me, in your peruſing this and the former pieces before they came to publick view, and in your brotherly and free animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon them, according as ye ſaw cauſe, which I do look upon as a very ſpecial kindneſſe and favour. And all of you have been ſo indulgent toward me, while at any time I have been neceſſitate to retire my ſelf for perfecting what I had undertaken, that I ſhould account my ſelf very ingrate, if I did not take hold of an occaſion to give ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick teſtimony of my ſpecial obligations unto you upon this very account. Next, Seeing it is the will of God, that <hi>the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject unto the Prophets,</hi> I hold it my duty in this Piece to give you an account of the ſubſtance of ſome of my labours in the common work of the Miniſtery with you in this place, as acknowledging that ye with the
<pb facs="tcp:114928:3"/>
reſt of the Reverend Presbytery, and other Judicatories eſtabliſhed by CHRIST, are over me in the LORD, and as a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that I look upon ſubjection and orderly walking, as a very ſpecial ornament of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the GOSPEL. Withall it is one of my ſpeciall purpoſes in this work, that not onely theſe of my particular charge might have preſented to their view, for their further edification, what they once heard in publick: But that (as our work and charge in this CITY, is in many reſpects common, ſo) I might make what was delivered to one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, common to all. And I could not think of a more fit mean to render it acceptable to them, then by its coming to them under your name, and with your approbation. Finally, (that I be not tedious,) I am much convinced of many obligations laid upon me to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the mercy of GOD toward me, that in this dark time of much confuſion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, he hath caſt my lot in the ſociety of ſo many faithful Servants of CHRIST, whoſe Company, Example, Counſel and Encouragement hath been ſo often refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and edifying unto me; and that (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever differences there are,) the LORD hath keeped our Society free of many of theſe woful and ſcandalous diſtractions which
<pb facs="tcp:114928:4"/>
have miſerably rent this afflicted Church; and which are a lamentation, and (if mercy prevent not,) will be for a lamentation, even to thoſe who for preſent look upon them with another eye. This mercy hath ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed me, that I could not but upon this occaſion leave my acknowledgement thereof upon Record, as not knowing when I might again have the like opportunity.</p>
            <p>As theſe reaſons, I hope, will plead for your candid interpretation of this application, and your favourable acceptance of this ſmall token of love and duty; So I purpoſe not to inſiſt in prefacing upon any ſubject unto you, to whom I rather profeſſe my ſelf a Scholar and Diſciple. Onely my deſire is, that as hitherto ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived mercy not to faint in the exerciſe of this Miniſtery, notwithſtanding the times that have gone over ſome of you; ſo ye may continue, and abound more and more, in feeding the flock of GOD which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, and being examples to them, in acquitting your ſelves as his wiſe and faithfull Servants, whoſe aime is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the KINGDOME of CHRIST, and the Truth of Piety, and to follow Truth with Peace and Sobriety, without
<pb facs="tcp:114928:4"/>
a byaſs or ſelfiſh and carnal deſigne: And my prayer to GOD for all of us ſhall be; that we may be daily more and more rooted and eſtabliſhed in the Truth, and in theſe wayes, that are well pleaſing in his ſight, and may be made willing and ready to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo any lot wherewith it ſhall pleaſe him to exerciſe us.

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have now, through the Lords aſſiſtance, finiſhed, and do here preſent thee with this Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe three Prophets, which with the Piece: formerly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, do compleat the whole leſſer Prophets according to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, when I publiſhed the firſt Piece. That I have publiſhed theſe last, when yet they are firſt in order, may (I confeſſe) ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange to any who ſhall not conſider, (according as I hinted in the Preface to the firſt,) that by a recommendation from a faithful Servant of CHRIST, I was only deſired to undertake <hi>Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> with ſome that follow, it being expected that others ſhould have done ſomewhat upon the three firſt, and ſome of the last of theſe Prophets. But finding that they could not, for divers reaſons, proſecute what they had purpoſed; I was ſtirred up to eſſay firſt theſe that followed after the Prophets I had undertaken, and then theſe now preſented to thee;
<pb facs="tcp:114928:6"/>
wherein it hath pleaſed the LORD to carry me on to this period.</p>
            <p>I do acknowledge, that beſide the conſcience of mine own inability, and the incumbrance of many diverſions from without; I have encountered with two great impediments in proſecuting this way of writing, eſpecially in this laſt Piece: One is, that in theſe Holy Writings, which runne much upon one ſtraine and ſubject, (as divers of theſe Prophets do,) however the ſtudying of one may contribute much light for underſtanding of another; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the variety of gifts communicated unto em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty men, were needfull for ſearching out the Rich Treaſures of Doctrine which are hid up in them, and that one man (eſpecially being of mean parts,) will on ſuch ſubjects readily ſoon wear out, and either abound in repetitions, or prove but barren in his collections from Rich Texts. The other is, that ſo much hath been already written on ſome of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, (beſide what is done on them all,) and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on <hi>Hoſea,</hi> not onely in the Latine tongue for the uſe of the Learned, but in Engliſh alſo, that it ſhould ſeem needleſſe to adde any more: Yet when I conſidered that the moſt part of the LORDS people could not make uſe of Latine Writings, and that what I have ſeen in Engliſh on <hi>Hoſea</hi> or <hi>Joel,</hi> is ſo large, that it may readily deterre many from buying or reading, and withall finding that none I could learn of, were about to do any thing upon them in ſhort; I have adventured over theſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to adde them to the former, that there might be an uniforme mould upon the whole: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe who ſhall take paines to read larger Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries,
<pb facs="tcp:114928:6"/>
will finde many ſweet diſcourſes and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, with refreſhful Digreſſions and Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which are not to be found here: Yet I hope that (according to the method propounded,) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reader may finde here, ſuch a plaine and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Analyſis, ſuch a ſound Expoſition (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Analyſis and coherence is cleared where it is needful,) and ſuch a collection of obvious obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, (in deducing whereof, the Expoſition is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times further enlarged, and particular phraſes and words not omitted,) as may be helpful unto him in reading of theſe Scriptures. And theſe all done ſo briefly, as may take away the excuſes of many who pleaſe themſelves too much in neglecting to converſe daily with the Scriptures, pretending their owne incapacity, and the prolixity of many helps offered unto them.</p>
            <p>My deſire unto thee (Chriſtian Reader,) is, that not only thou would accept of this my endeavour, as thou haſt been pleaſed to do formerly, beyond my expectation and deſerving; and that thou pray with me that GOD would ſtirre up others, to undertake ſome other place of Scripture, in this or the like brief way; and particularly the greater Prophets, and ſome of the Writings of the New Teſtament, which contain the Marrow of Divinity: But alſo that in the mean time thou would make right uſe of this and the like helps offered unto thee. I need not make uſe of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſaying, who profeſſed if he thought his Writings would take up mens time from reading the Scriptures, he would like <hi>Saturne,</hi> devour his own children. For thou canſt not read this, but almoſt at every ſentence it
<pb facs="tcp:114928:7"/>
will lead thee to the Scripture: And it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy duty to give obedience unto God commanding thee to read and underſtand, but it addes much to the obligation, that GOD hath not only reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his minde concerning the ſalvation of loſt ſinners, but hath regiſtrate the ſame in Holy Writing, to prevent deluſion and forgetfulneſſe, and perpetuate his Truth in the World, and hath contrived it ſo, as with little expence and trouble, thou may have it, and carry it about with thee; and that he hath ſet apart his Servants daily to open it up unto thee; and employeth ſome by writing, to contribute their endeavours for thy good. It cannot alſo but commend Scripture unto thee, if thou conſider that it is Gods Charter put in thy hand concerning thy eternal happineſſe, that as by prayer thou keeps converſe with God in Heaven, ſo by the Scriptures GOD converſeth with thee, and ſpeaks and daily ſends miſſives unto thee, and that what thou, who in the ſenſe of thy ſinne and miſery haſt fled to Chriſt, findes there anſwering thy neceſſity, cometh not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee at adventure or by chance; but is as really intended for thee, as if it had been written to thee in particular, and by name: And ſo the Apoſtle applies that general ſentence of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbes, as ſpoken to his preſent hearers under their preſent preſſures, <hi>Ye have forgotten the exhortation which ſpeaketh unto you, as unto children, My ſonne, deſpiſe not thou the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him,</hi> Heb. <hi>12.5.</hi> In a word, If the Law of God be thy meditation and delight, thou wilt finde God there, it will keep thee ſpiritual and heavenly-minded, it will make thee wiſer then thy

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prophet was ſent out among the firſt of thoſe whoſe writings are recorded in Scripture, being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at the ſame time; at firſt with <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and then with him and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah</hi> in <hi>Judah,</hi> and with <hi>Amos</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the ſeveral Titles of theſe Prophecies hold forth.

               <p>The Commiſſion of this Prophet is delivered partly in Types, <hi>Chap. 1, 2, 3</hi> and parlty in expreſſe termes in the reſt of the Book. In the firſt of theſe, he more briefly challengeth them for their ſin, eſpecially Idolatry, denounceth judgements againſt them, and foretels their rejection; and yet comforts the godly with predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Goſpel-mercies, and particularly with promiſes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of that Nation, and of Gods renewing the Covenant with them after their long rejection and ſequeſtration. In the ſecond, he doth more at large proſecute Gods Controverſie againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> eſpecially in ſharp accuſations, and ſad ſentences for the many hainous iniquities, committed both by private and publick perſons, againſt both firſt and ſecond Tables of the Law: His Scope in all, which is to invite them to repentance, and if they continued obſtinate, that God might be juſtified in his judgements, and they rendered inexcuſable. This taske he performes in ſuch ſharp and conciſe termes, as might teſtifie how his heart filled with zeal and love to God, ſtood affected to their way; and with very little intimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any hope of future mercie, till towards the end, wherein he brings forth Gods purpoſe of love, and in the very cloſe ſummeth up all with Evangelical, and ample promiſes to them.</p>

The Divine authority of this Doctrine, and his calling to publiſh it. 3. The time of his Miniſtery, which is reckoned by the reignes of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> in that time, though he preached unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> becauſe (as would appear,) the fearful miſcarriages of moſt of theſe Kings, and the confuſions occaſioned thereby, rendered them unworthy of being taken notice of by God. Only <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, one of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s race, is mentioned, partly to ſhew that he did not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114928:10"/>
begin to Propheſy toward the end of <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s reigne, but even in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time, who began his reigne before <hi>Uzziah,</hi> (or <hi>Azariah,</hi>) 2 Kings 14.23. and 15.1. and ended it a good while before him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.8. and ſo it intimates that he Propheſied long, and continuing in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> it is likely that he ſaw the captivity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was in the ſixth year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 18.10. partly, this is marked, to ſhew that <hi>Hoſea</hi> began thus to Propheſy, not when the declining condition of affaires under the ſucceeding Kings, might repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any theſe ſad things which he foretold, but when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in a moſt flouriſhing condition, as it was under this King, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.23, 25. From this Inſcription, <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Whoever be the inſtrument that carrieth the Lords meſſage, it is ſtill our duty to ſtudy the Divine Authority of his Word and Meſſages ſent by them, that ſo we may know whereon to lane; that we may be attentive, conſidering we have to do with God, and not with men and vain terrours from them; and that it may take the envy of any hard Meſſage from off inſtruments, as flowing no way from their humors, or deſire to diſturbe the common tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity: For theſe cauſes is the Divine Authority of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in particular aſſerted it is, <hi>The word of the Lord to Hoſea, the ſon of Beeri.</hi> See 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. 2. As it is the duty of the Lords faithful ſervants, to preach only Gods Word to his people; ſo for performing of this, it is required, not only that they have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities and endowments, but authority and a calling alſo, which may aſſure them of aſſiſtance and ſucceſſe in ſome meaſure, and of ſupport under any difficulties they meet with; Therefore it is called, <hi>The word of the Lord that came unto Hoſea;</hi> The Lords Word came unto him to call him to the Office, and being called, he received the enſuing Meſſages by Inſpiration, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Revelation, and theſe only be recordeth and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. 3. Such is the goodneſſe and long-ſuffering of God, as not to give up with his ſinful people at firſt, but he will purſue them with meſſages from himſelf, even for a long time, and till their caſe prove irrecoverable; For, ſo much doth he manifeſt by continuing <hi>Hoſea</hi> in his Miniſtery for ſo long a time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Apoſtaſy, <hi>The word of the Lord came unto Hoſea, in the dayes of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hozekiah, &amp;c.</hi> See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14, 15, 16. 4. It may be the lot of the Lords faithful ſervants, that when they have ſpent their time and ſtrength, for a long time among a people, yet they become worſe, and go to ruine; For, notwithſtanding <hi>Hoſeas</hi> paines for ſo

As the Lord may have ſad ſtrokes coming on a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they are in the height of proſperity, and have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all their outward enemies; So, however wicked people do abuſe their proſperity, and turne it into a ſnare for themſelves, yet ſpiritual obſervers will not be blinded therewith, but will ſee ſad wrath under all of it, ready to break forth: For, this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage containing ſad threatenings, came <hi>in the dayes of Jeroboam, the ſon of Joaſh, King of Iſrael;</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was flouriſhing, and then the Prophet ſaw it. 7. It is in ſpecial commendation of faithfull Miniſters, when the proſperity of an impenitent people doth not tempt them to Propheſy ſmooth things, but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce wrath moſt ſtoutly againſt a people liable to it, when the Lords diſpenſations ſeem to promiſe the contrary: Therefore <hi>in the dayes of Jeroboam,</hi> when all ſeemed to go well, and when therefore faithful Prophets could hardly be ſuffered, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10, 12. even then doth he ſo freely plead the Lords controverſie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

by the Prophets taking a wife of whoredomes; which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome underſtand literally, and that <hi>Hoſea</hi> did this, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to juſtifie it by Gods extraordinary command, who might warrant <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſpoile the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his own Son; yet (beſide what difference may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the actions themſelves, between mens taking of reward and wages for their long and hard ſervice, and offering up to God what was his own, and this fact of a Prophet making himſelf the member of an harlot,) this would ſeem probable. 1. That the Prophet took not ſo long a time in preaching this one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as was requiſite for marrying a woman, and having three children by her, ſhe her ſelf giving them ſuck and weaning them, far leſſe that he ſhould take yet another, (as he is commanded <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.1.) either with her, or after her in ſo ſhort time, and ſhould multiplie ſuch ſtrange facts. 2. That in a time wherein the Prophets perſon and calling was already much in contempt, the Lord would not enjoyne him that as a duty, which might juſtly adde to it, as being not only ſpecially prohibited unto the Miniſters of holy things, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21.1, 7. but at the ſame time wherein <hi>Hoſea</hi> lived, was threatened as a curſe upon a falſe Prieſt, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.17. Therefore I rather underſtand it typically, that the Prophet is commanded under this type, to point out the great Idolatry of the land, and their defection thereby from God; and to declare that the Nation was ſuch to God, as if after he had taken a wife; ſhe had plaid the harlot; and particular perſons were ſuch, as if his wives children were <hi>children of whoredomes,</hi> that is, ſuſpected to be Baſtards, being borne of ſuch a mother, though going under his name; or given to whoredome in imitation of their mother. And accordingly the Prophets taking <hi>Gomer the daughter of Diblaim,</hi> is his preaching their caſe under ſuch a type, and the names here uſed, may either be taken properly for the name of a famous ſtrumpet in that time, daughter to ſuch a one, who might fitly reſemble <hi>Iſraels</hi> filthineſſe; or, they may be taken appellatively, the firſt word <hi>Gomer,</hi> ſignifying either <hi>perfection,</hi> or <hi>conſumption,</hi> and the ſecond <hi>Diblaim,</hi> being either the name of a great wilderneſſe, called <hi>Diblath, Ezek.</hi> 6.14. or ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>cluſter,</hi> or <hi>cakes of figs,</hi> (as a word like this is tranſlated, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.40. 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 30.12.) which were uſed in Feaſts: Both theſe may very fitly point out the condition of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom God is now challenging, as being brought from an howling wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe and deſolate condition, and made perfect through his comlineſs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.3,—14. but now becauſe of her ſenſuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

drawing her unto, and attending her Idolatry, was to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. <hi>Doctrine,</hi> 1. Such as would profit by the Word, will finde it not enough to acknowledge in general the authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, unleſſe they have ſerious thoughts of it in receiving every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular meſſage, and particularly hard tydings; Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the general inſcription, <hi>v.</hi> 1. we have the divine authority of this particular meſſage twice aſſerted, it is. <hi>The word of the Lord by Hoſea,</hi> or, <hi>in Hoſea,</hi> to wit, by divine inſpiration; And, <hi>The Lord ſaid it to Hoſea.</hi> 2. Whatever be the Lords tenderneſſe and meekneſſe, and his allowance that his ſervants deal ſo with ſuch as ſin through ignorance and infirmity, and are not hardened in their ſin; yet when a people are obſtinate and deſperate in ſinning, it is the Lords will they be handled ſharply, and peremptorily dealt with; For, this ſad challenge, is the firſt Meſſage put in <hi>Hoſeas</hi> mouth to this people; <hi>It is the beginning of the word of the Lord,</hi> or the firſt meſſage he got in commiſſion. 3. Albeit it ſhould be the care of Miniſters to gain the affections of people, that way may be made for their meſſage; yet they would guard, leſt in ſo doing, they blunt the edge of zeal, and quit their fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatever groſſe iniquities may be in the viſible Church, and whatever Gods controverſie may be becauſe of them; yet the great ſin and cauſe of Gods controverſie is, when ſhe corrupts Religion, and eſpecially when ſhe makes A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy unto Idolatry: Therefore doth the Lord begin with this, as the great challenge againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 5. Idolatry, eſpecially in the Church, is ſpiritual whoredome, becauſe it ſtrikes at the marriage-tie and relation betwixt God and his people, and takes in another lover; and therefore is more hainous in the Church, then among Pagans; and becauſe it is an irreconcileable fault, as awaking jealouſie, which the Scripture calleth <hi>the rage of a man:</hi> Therefore is it called <hi>whoredome,</hi> and their ſinfulneſs is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by <hi>a wife of whoredomes;</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.4, 5. 6 As I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry is exceedingly aggreaged, by the conſideration of the partie whom Idolaters do deſert, who is <hi>the Lord Jehovah;</hi> and by their obligations unto him, by reaſon of many favours, being the land or the people, who were ſetled in that promiſed land by his eſpecial hand, and who enjoyed ſpecial dignities and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in it, and by the gene above: flowing of this ſin, when it is not ſome few only, but <hi>the land,</hi> all of them, and the body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114928:12"/>
of the Nation who fall in it: So whatever Idolaters may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend of cleaving to God, together with their Idols, (as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28.) yet the Lord will look upon them as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecters of him and his yoke, and ſuch as he wil have no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>The land hath committed whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, departing from the Lord,</hi> or, <hi>whoredome from after the Lord,</hi> as in effect renouncing all ſubjection to him, and caſting him off, whatever they pretend; See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16. 7. It is the plague of God on a viſible Church, that when ſhe renounceth God and his Worſhip, ſhe is given up to be exceedingly groſſe in Idolatry, and corrupting the Worſhip of God, as not only the fruit of her inclination, but that Gods judicial upgiving of her may alſo be ſeen in it; Therefore is <hi>Iſrael</hi> reſembled to <hi>a wife of whoredomes,</hi> or a wife eminently and ſuperlatively whoriſh, as the Original forme of ſpeech imports; See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.46, 47, 48, 51, 52. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. 8. Idolatry is alſo an intangling ſin, which when the Church once falleth into, ſhe is ſtill the more enamoured and taken with it, and goeth the more inceſſantly on, adding one degree of defection to another; to which ſhe is given up of God, as a puniſhment for her preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to debord in the leaſt; ſo much alſo are we taught in the challenge, <hi>The land hath committed great whoredome,</hi> or, <hi>in whoring hath gone a whoring,</hi> one ſtep hath drawn on another, as the Original imports. 9. A Church making defection from God unto Idolatry, doth bring great prejudice upon her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or particular members, either by drawing them into defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with her, or by making them ſhare in the ſad effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Therefore albeit an Idolatrous Church may bring forth children unto God, ſo long as he hath not given her a bill of divorce, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. yet the ſtate of the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is here repreſented under the type <hi>of children of whoredomes;</hi> partly, becauſe Idolatry was not only authorized and enjoyned by the repreſentatives of Church and State, but generally embraced by the people; and partly, becauſe when ſuch an iniquity overfloweth, it fareth the worſe with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members for their ſake, and they do ſhare in the common plagues as children of whoredomes: Idolatry is a ſpeciall ſin, the ſad effects whereof may follow poſterity long, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. 10. As a people do grow in ſin, or draw neerer judgement, they become the more ſtupid, and inſenſible of their ſin and danger; for this cauſe it is that <hi>Iſrael</hi> needs theſe types to inculcate this Doctrine. 11.

This is typically held forth under the repreſentation of three children, brought forth to the Prophet by this wife of whoredomes; whereby is ſignified a threefold period of the ripening of their ſin, and a threefold degree of their ruine and deſtruction: And in this the type doth ſuite well, for as children are the fruit of Marriage, or of unlawful conjunction under cloak of an Husband, ſo their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and other ſins being ripe, did at laſt bring forth that ſad fruit.</p>
                     <p>The firſt ſon called <hi>Jezreel,</hi> did intimate ſins coming to an height under <hi>Jehu</hi>'s poſterity; for which the Lord threatens ſhortly to call them to an accompt, and to take vengeance on <hi>Jehu</hi>'s race for his bloodſhed committed on the houſe of <hi>Abab,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9, and 10th. Chap. as accordingly was accompliſhed on <hi>Zechariah,</hi> the ſon of this <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who reigned but ſix moneths before he was ſlain by a conſpiracy, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.8, 9, 10, 12. This ſtroak is amplified from ſome effects thereof, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114928:13"/>
by it not only <hi>Jehu</hi>'s race ſhould be cut off, but the Kingdome ſhould ceaſe, or get ſuch a blow in their fall, and after it, as it ſhould never recover its former vigour till it were deſtroyed: And that their warlike power ſhould be broken, even in the very heart of their Countrey, and in the valley lying before <hi>Jezreel,</hi> which was one of the habitations of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.1. of which ſee <hi>Joſh.</hi> 17.16. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.33. To all this prediction doth the childes name, <hi>Jezreel</hi> agree, as being to be puniſhed for the blood which was ſhed in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> as being a den of bloody robbers, as <hi>Ahab</hi> made <hi>Jezreel</hi> by killing <hi>Naboth;</hi> and being in ſtead of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to become <hi>Jezreel,</hi> or <hi>ſcattered of the Lord,</hi> and broken by diviſions, as they were after that time till they were utterly ſcattered. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever preſent fruits men may ſeem to reap by ſin, yet at laſt, being continued in, it will ripen to an height, and fit for ſtroakes; for this wife of whoredomes <hi>doth conceive and bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Notwithſtanding that ſinners in the Church do conceit of their priviledges; yet God will not only plague them, but make their ſin and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as conſpicuous, as if it were their very name; For, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto him, Call his name Jezreel,</hi> whereby is ſignified, that however they gloried in the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet the Lord ſhould make them become a <hi>Jezreel</hi> by manifeſting of their ſin, and by plagues for it. 3. Albeit Idolatry be the great ſin of the Church, and doth deſerve ſaddeſt judgements; yet the Lord uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to give up ſuch Apoſtates unto other groſſe wickedneſſes, to let them and the world ſee the fruit of their departing from God, and by all theſe ſinnes together to haſten the judgement: For, albeit the chief ſin and cauſe of Gods controverſie, be Idolatry, <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet for theſe cauſes, are they given up to murther and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with it. 4. The Lord is ſo reſpective of man made after his Image, and of juſtice and equity among men, as the blood, even of theſe who are wicked, and deſerve deſtruction at Gods hand, will not be unrevenged on theſe who ſhed it unwarrantably, either for their way, or end in it; <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>avenge the blood,</hi> (or, <hi>bloods) of Jezreel,</hi> or the blood of <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, the Lords requiring whereof, gives ample ground of hope to expect the like of others, who ſuffer more innocently; See <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6. Pſ. 9.12. He nameth it <hi>bloods,</hi> becauſe there were many ſlaughters, even of all <hi>Ahabs</hi> family, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.11. together with <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9.27. and his brethren, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.13, 14.

                        <hi>Samaria,</hi> and elſewhere, yet not only did the execution begin, or was moſt there, and was done elſewhere by <hi>Jehu</hi>'s authority in <hi>Jezreel,</hi> but becauſe what was done there on <hi>Jehoram,</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel,</hi> ſeemed to be moſt juſtifiable, becauſe of foregoing Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.25, 26, 36, 37. and yet the Lord will avenge it. 5. Men may not only be doing that which God in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Providence will permit to ſucceed, but even that which is in it ſelf juſt, and materially Gods command, and yet be guilty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and juſtly puniſhed for it, when either they do not the Lords work ſincerely, but for their own baſe ends and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or when they do it not throughly, but only in ſo farre as may ſerve their own turne: For, albeit <hi>Jehu</hi> was anointed at Gods command, to execute his judgement on <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.6, 7. yea, and temporally rewarded for it, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.30. yet it is here accounted murther, to be avenged on his houſe, becauſe he did it not out of zeal for God, but to get a Kingdome to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and becauſe (which is an evidence of the former) he did only ſo much as might ſerve his ends, and eſtabliſh him in the Kingdome: For, though he executed Gods quarrel on <hi>Ahab</hi> and his houſe, and on <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts and followers, yet he clave to the Idolatry of the calves for ſecuring his own intereſt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.31. and ſo proved himſelf more careful of his own affaires and ſetling, then of Religion. 6. Men may proſper a while in a courſe, againſt which the Lord hath a ſtanding quarrel, and will avenge it on their poſterity: For, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the houſe of Jehu,</hi> though himſelf and his next ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours were exempted for a time, which as it may be dreadful to men who proſper in an ill way, who may be made to rot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ground in plagues on their poſterity; So it may warne men not to follow the ſins of their predeceſſors, meerely becauſe they proſpered in their hand. 7. However ſinners may bleſſe themſelves; when judgements ſeem to be afar off; yet they will at laſt draw near, and any thing that is meaſured by time, will ſoon come about; For, notwithſtanding the promiſe given to <hi>Jehu</hi> and his poſterity for ſome generations, yet now it is, <hi>Yet a little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel, &amp;c.</hi> 8. As Kingdomes have their periods prefixed by God; ſo there may be ſo much anger againſt a Nation evidenced in the ſmiting even of their wicked Magiſtrates, and ſo great commotions in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of them, and confuſions following thereupon, as may not only be a preſage of the overthrow of a Kingdome, but will give it ſuch an irreparable ſtroak, and ſo break the power thereof, as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114928:14"/>
it ſhall never recover, eſpecially continuing in the ſame ſins: Therefore is it ſubjoyned to this ſtroak on <hi>Jehu</hi>'s houſe, <hi>And I will cauſe to ceaſe the Kingdome of the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> for though it endured a while after, yet this was a preſage of it, and they never recovered of that ſtroake, but were broken by confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and diſtractions, till the forreigne enemie came upon them, as is hinted at in the next verſe, and expreſſed more at length in their miſerable condition, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. 9 As there is no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor ſtrength of a Kingdom able to reſiſt God coming in anger: So the Lords breaking of a Kingdomes power, and exhauſting it totally, is a ſad evidence of his diſpleaſure, and preſage of further ruine; Therefore is it added as a part of the ſtroak, and the way how the Kingdome came to ceaſe, <hi>At that day I will break the bowe of Iſrael,</hi> under <hi>the bowe</hi> (much uſed among them, and whereof <hi>Jehu</hi> made ſpecial uſe, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.24.) comprehending all warlike power: And that he will do this in the valley of <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> that is, not ſo much by any battel there, (of which we read not elſewhere) as that they ſhould not be broken by any diſcomfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on their borders, which the Kingdome might repaire again; but this decay ſhould reach the very heart of their Countrey, where their ſtrength and royall Cities were, and where they thought themſelves ſecure, and therefore were inſolent in oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bloodſhed, and this expoſed them to the calamities which followed.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond childe is a daughter, called <hi>Lo-ruhamah,</hi> or, <hi>not having obtained mercy;</hi> This type is made uſe of (as would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear) to point at that period of their ſins, ripening for the ſtroak of a begun captivity, by <hi>Tiglah-pileſer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> of which ſee, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. The Lord declareth that this time ſhould be a time of no mercy, (as the childes name ſignified,) becauſe he would not <hi>adde any more,</hi> (as he had done formerly, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14 25, 26, 27.) to manifeſt his mercy toward them in their affliction, but would make that captivity irrecoverable, and a

preſage of the captivity of the whole Nation, which ſhortly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. and under which they are held to this day. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever be the Lords prerogative of free-grace, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering when and whom he will; and whatever be his pitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his own, who cry to him under juſtly procured afflictions, yet ſuch as continue in ſin, after the Lord hath ſmitten them, may expect that their calamities will not expiate their ſin, but that God will purſue them with ſtroake upon ſtroak; Therefore albeit Iſrael was plagued and broken before, yet ſince they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their defection from the true worſhip of God, and from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> this ripens to a new birth of judgement; <hi>She conceived again, and bare, &amp;c.</hi> 2. It is a ſad judgement, when the Lord not only weakens a people outwardly, but takes away alſo manly ſpirits from them, and they became like women either for doing or ſuffering. So much may be imported by this type of <hi>a daughter;</hi> that the eſtate of the people after the former ſtroake, and at the coming on of this, was quite broken, and themſelves effeminate; ſo that they were content to take any tearmes of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who moleſted them, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.19. (which is called a light affliction in reſpect of this that followed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.1.) and did quietly ſtoop under ſo many murthering Kings, who did riſe every one upon the ruines of another. When men are in ſuch a temper, conſcience will readily be trampled on, through baſeneſſe. 3. It is a ſad ingredient of an afflicted condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Gods mercy and bowels of compaſſion are withheld from a people under it, when they have no aſſurance of a roome in his heart, and ſympathy, (which is a faire advantage,) nor any effects thereof manifeſted in moderating, or delivering from it: Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Call her name Lo-ruhamah: for I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The ſadneſſe of this condition may be read in the Churches complaint, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. and in Gods promiſe to his children, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33, 34. 4. However the Lord do manifeſt much mercy toward a viſible Church, and ſhe be ready to preſume on that, yet abuſe of former mercy, may bring the exerciſe of mercy toward a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, to a period; For, ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>adde no more to have mercy,</hi> as of before; and the ſad evidence of this condition is, that their former rods had not been bleſſed, but their abuſe thereof by their continuance in ſin, had drawn forth this new rod, with this ſad note upon it. 5. Where the Lord denies his mercy under affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not only will that ſtroak prove irrecoverable, but it is an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114928:15"/>
evidence of moe ſtrokes to come, till a people be conſumed; for, ſaith he, <hi>I will no more have mercy, but I will utterly take them away,</hi> that is, ſeeing I deny mercy, not only ſhall this captivity be without recovery, but moe of them, even the whole Nation, ſhall follow.</p>

                     <p>This ſad condition of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is illuſtrate from the contrary condition of <hi>Judah,</hi> who adhered better unto the Covenant. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>Judah</hi> was both before and after this moleſted by <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 7.1, &amp;c. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.12, &amp;c. and looked on as forlorne by them; yet the Lord promiſeth to manifeſt mercy unto them, and deliver them from their enemies, and that not by ordinary meanes and wayes, but by his own immediate hand, or by Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.17. and by vertue of the Covenant, <hi>Zech.</hi> 9.11. This was verified in their deliverance from <hi>Senacherib,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was carried captive, and <hi>Judah</hi> was very low; and in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne from the Babyloniſh captivity. <hi>Hoſea</hi> doth thus ſpeak favourably of <hi>Judah,</hi> whom their own Prophets dealt more round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with, not only becauſe he was ſent chiefly to inſiſt on <hi>Iſraels</hi> condition, but becauſe <hi>Judah</hi> in his dayes had none of the worſt Kings, except <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and eſpecially an <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to whoſe dayes this ſeems eſpecially to relate; and becauſe they were in many things better then <hi>Iſrael.</hi> as <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.12. and were accordingly better, dealt with. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord cut off a ſinfull people, pretending intereſt in him, yet will he not want a Church to whom he will be kinde, and whoſe priviledge ſhall be, to be the object of his mercy; for, at this time of calamity on <hi>Iſrael, I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah,</hi> ſaith he, 2. It will be an aggravation of backſliders miſery to ſee others who waite on God, well dealt with, when they reap the fruit of their doings; Therefore is <hi>Judah</hi>'s lot ſet in oppoſition to theirs, to imbitter their cup: <hi>I will no more have mercy upon the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> verſ 6. <hi>But I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah,</hi> 3. Great mercy may be attending a people, who yet may be plunged in great difficulties; for, ſo was <hi>Judah</hi> after this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, both by <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.5, 6, &amp;c. and by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114928:15"/>
the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.13. we muſt not meaſure Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of love by preſent croſſes, without which we could not take up his mercy well. 4. The mercy of God is a fountaine from whence deliverance will flow, according to the tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and the ſafety and deliverance of the Church is a thing out of queſtion, though ſhe oft-times fall in debate with God about the way and means of it; for, upon this, <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> it followeth, <hi>I will ſave them,</hi> and it is an abſolute promiſe, <hi>I will ſave them,</hi> though he will not take theſe wayes to do it, that the Church uſually looks moſt unto. 5. The Lord needs not creature-helps, nor is he ſo tied to meanes, as that he cannot work greateſt things without and above them; yea, he oft-times delights to act more immediately for his Church, and to take her as the forlorne into his own hand for, ſaith he, <hi>I will ſave them by the Lord their God,</hi> that is, (as is before explained) by his own hand, through Jeſus Chriſt, and by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and thus he ſaves them, though he <hi>will not ſave them by bowe, &amp;c.</hi> 6. The Lords laying aſide probable meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments in delivering his people, is for their double advantage; for not only are they certainly delivered, but their deliverance that way, doth aſſure them of their intereſt in God, through Chriſt by vertue of a Covenant ſtanding firme in the midſt of all their afflictions; for, the God by whom they are ſaved is then ſeen to be <hi>the Lord their God.</hi> 7. Albeit deliverance of the Lords Church from her troubles, be a ſweet mercy, and call for praiſe, whatever way the Lord be pleaſed to ſend it; and albeit the Lords people, having his calling, may by warre aſſert themſelves into freedome: yet it is a ſpecial mercy, when the Lord not only ſaves by his own hand, but without warre, and bloodſhed, not only becauſe he humbleth them ſo farre, and ſo advanceth their ſpiritual good; but becauſe warre, even when it brings ſafety, is a terrible lot, and in effect a ſcourge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſuch diſtempers and effects, as may leave matter of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation in the midſt of greateſt deliverances; ſo much alſo may be gathered from this, that the Lord <hi>will not ſave them by bowe, nor by ſword, nor by battel, by horſes, nor by horſemen,</hi> that is, neither by military preparations nor actians, how promiſing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but by his own hand, anſwering the mournful prayers of his people, as in <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s dayes.</p>

Such is the long-ſuffering patience of God, eſpecially toward the viſible Church, that he is not only ſlow to anger, and to manifeſt the ſame by judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but even when he hath begun to ſtrike, he yet waits pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently to ſee what uſe they will make of preſent judgements, to prevent future and ſadder ſtroakes; and in particular, it is very long ere the Lord come to unchurch a people that have been in Covenant with him; So much are we taught in this type, that this ſtroak came not till the birth of the third childe, and that this childe was not conceived till <hi>after ſhe had weaned Lo-ruha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah,</hi> which took up a longer time, then if ſhe bad given it ſuck by another. 2. However the Lords long-ſuffering patience be great and admirable, yet it will not laſt alwayes toward a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people, eſpecially after he hath begun to plead with them, but will at laſt come to a ſad period: For, at laſt <hi>ſhe conceived and bare a ſon,</hi> typifying their utter rejection. 3. Albeit no limits ought to be ſet to the freedome and efficacy of the grace of God, who can and doth ſanctifie afflictions unto the Church, and make them a mean to turne her, and cauſe her cleave faſter to him: yet it doth alſo oft-times prove too true, that when the Lord begins to contend with her, ſhe proves ſo obſtinate in ſin, and ſo incorrigible and inceſſant in defection, that nothing ends it but her utter rejection, at leaſt for a time: For, ſuch was the iſſue of his former diſpenſations with Iſrael, as is to be ſeen till this day. 4. The capeſtone of all judgements upon a people, (and in which they will reſolve, if not made uſe of,) is their unchurching, and cutting off the relations betwixt God and them; For, this is the ſad and final ſtroak on <hi>Iſrael: Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God,</hi> or, <hi>not be yours,</hi> as it is in the Original, See the like forme of ſpeech, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Thou becameſt mine,</hi> or my people. 5. Whatever may follow
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114928:16"/>
upon Gods ſmiting of a people in ſeverity, and their not making uſe thereof, yet his relation and intereſt in a people, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be meaſured by his ſeverity in ſtriking, or denying any expreſſion of his compaſſion and ſympathy under it; For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former ſtroakes they were <hi>Lo-ruhamah,</hi> and yet came not to be <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> till this ſtroak. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15, 16. 6. When ever the Lord gives up with a people as to being their God, he will make it appear that the breach began on their ſide, and that they firſt voluntarily rejected him, and chooſed that ſtate and condition ſinfully, to which, and the effects thereof, he gives them up judicially: So much doth the order of this ſentence import, <hi>ye are not my people,</hi> and therefore it is reaſon he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne, <hi>I will not be your God.</hi> 7. A people may ſeem to be on the recovering hand for outward ſtrength, yea and poſſibly ſeem not to be ſo ill as formerly, when their utter captivity is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at hand: So much ſeemeth to be repreſented to us, in that the type of this laſt ſtroak is <hi>a ſon,</hi> (whereas in the former it was <hi>a daughter,</hi>) pointing at their condition about the time of their captivity; partly, in that they recovered ſome little ſtrength, making them attempt to free themſelves of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> yoke, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. Hereby teaching how little cauſe impenitent ſinners have to truſt to outward appearances, even albeit they ſeem to have wraſtled out of many difficulties, and to be upon the amending hand. And partly, in that they were not ſo ill as formerly, neither their King, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.2. (who, it may be, let all that would go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and worſhip, as ſome conceive that Paſſeover, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. was before their final cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,) nor yet were the people, at leaſt ſome of them ſo ill; For, they did their wickedneſſe <hi>ſecretly,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.9. and yet then they went into captivity. Hereby warning all that ſmaller ſins of a preſent age, joyned with the groſſer abominations of predeceſſors will ſoon fill up a cup; and that any ſeeming refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, when it is not through, nor former defections mourned for, and any liberty a people enjoy after bondage, when it is not improven, do but haſten on judgements. Withall, it may be the Lord did this that he might ſend them away with ſome ſenſe of God and his Worſhip, for their uſe in their captivity.</p>

                     <p>Unto theſe threatenings are ſubjoyned ſome Goſpel-promiſes, for the comfort of the godly who ſhould taſte of theſe calamities. The firſt Promiſe is, that though <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be rejected as a Nation, yet the true <hi>Iſraelite</hi> of <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhould be increaſed under the Goſpel, as the ſand of the Sea: And though their being caſt out of their Land ſhould be an evidence of their rejection, as well as the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were; yet in all places throughout the World, where they and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, they ſhould enjoy the dignity and the priviledges of the Sonnes of God. This Prediction is ſo expreſſely applied both to <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 9.24, 25, 26. and to the ſcattered ſtrangers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.1. with 2.10. that there is no doubt to be made of it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. In a time of greateſt ſeverity, the Lord remembereth mercy, and doth not alter his purpoſe of being great, and getting Worſhippers in the World: For, ſo much doth this Promiſe teach. 2. Albeit the godly in their dayes and generation ſhould meet with nothing but hard lots; yet it may be a comfort unto them, under preſent hard diſpenſations, that there are promiſes of better dayes to be accompliſhed in after-ages: and in particular, the Prediction of Goſpel-times and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, was the comfort of the godly under the Law, much more ſhould the accompliſhment be ſo to us: Therefore doth the Lord by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> comfort the godly in his time with theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; See <hi>Luke</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.21. 3. Believers of all Nations are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and the true <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whatever became of <hi>Iſraels</hi> temporal priviledges, yet their ſpiritual priviledges were not loſt, when they were caſt out, but diſtributed among Believers of them, and the reſt of the children; For, they are called, <hi>The children of Iſrael,</hi> and come to be the <hi>Sonnes</hi> and People of GOD: See <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6, 16. 4. The encreaſe of the Church is a great mercy, and doth richly make up the diſperſion and ſcattering of any viſible
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114928:17"/>
Church; Therefore is it held out as the encouragement; <hi>The number of the children of Iſrael, ſhall be as the ſand of the Sea, which cannot be meaſured nor numbred.</hi> 5. The Lord is ſtill mindful of his Covenant, and ſo careful of performing the ſame, that whatever appear to the contrary, yet he will ſtill make it good one way or other; and in particular the promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> concerning the multiplying of his ſeed, is richly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed under the Goſpel, though his ſeed after the fleſh be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected for a time; Therefore doth he repeat that promiſe to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham Gen.</hi> 22.17. as a thing that would not fail, and to be accompliſhed under the Goſpel. 6. The priviledges of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the Goſpel and better Covenant, have an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the times under the Law; and the priviledges of the truly godly, are far above theſe of any viſible Church whatſoever, Therefore in oppoſition to their being <hi>not my people,</hi> it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, not only that they ſhall be my people, but <hi>Sonnes.</hi> And it is thus expreſſed, partly, becauſe however the Covenant under the Old and New Teſtament, be the ſame in ſubſtance, yet the priviledges are more ample, clear and diſtinct now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Though his people were then children, yet they were keeped under the condition of a ſervant, whereas now their Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is more clear. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 7. and partly, becauſe the external ſtate and priviledges of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> come far ſhort of the dignities of the <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Spirit, who are not only people and ſubjects, but Sons by vertue of Regeneration and Adoption. 7. As it is an high dignity to become children, Sons and Heires unto God, ſo this dignity doth appear more diſtinctly, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that God, to whom they have relation, is not a dumb idol, but the living God, who hath life in himſelf, who is the Fountain of all life, and the Author of eternal life to all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; For, it is their dignity, <hi>Ye are the ſonnes of the living God.</hi> 8. Grace in God can, and doth make choice of ſuch to be his children, as had no relation to him, or ſuch as had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited all their relations and priviledges; and they who are thus advanced, ought not to forget what they were without it: For, theſe who were <hi>not my people,</hi> (either <hi>Gentiles,</hi> without God, or <hi>Iſraelites</hi> rejected and put from their priviledges,) are made <hi>ſons of the living God,</hi> and this is put in the promiſe to minde them of it. 9. It is a comfortable and refreſhful mercy, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is taking place in the World where it was not before; and it is the advantage of Goſpel-times, that the Church is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to one Nation or Countrey, but in all places God may be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114928:18"/>
ſerved, and our intereſt in him avowed: For, they get this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, <hi>in the place where it was ſaid unto them, Ye are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> that is, throughout the World where the <hi>Gentiles</hi> lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> diſperſion there, was an evidence of their rejection, and ſo their condition ſaid it to them, beſide the verdict of the Word againſt them; See <hi>John</hi> 4.21. 10. It is alſo a great advantage, when the Lords goodneſſe to his Saints and their way, doth convince the World of their excellencie, and neither their afflictions nor carriage doth make them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, nor cauſe the World to ſtumble at them: So much may be gathered from this, <hi>it ſhall be ſaid unto them, Ye are the ſonnes of the living God,</hi> not only ſhall the Goſpel call and bring them to this dignity, and paſſe ſuch a ſentence in their favours, but others ſhall be made to acknowledge and admire it in them; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.9,</p>

                     <p>The ſecond Promiſe ſeemes to relate more eſpecially to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the letter, holding forth their future recollection and union with <hi>Judah</hi> under Chriſt their Head, and their coming up out of their forlorne condition, to enjoy the priviledges allowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. The ſame Promiſe for ſubſtance is alſo held forth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Eezek.</hi> 27. from <hi>ver.</hi> 16, to 26. As for this part of the promiſe, <hi>They ſhall come up out of the land,</hi> albeit it be ſpoken with alluſion unto the Babyloniſh captivity, from whence <hi>Judah</hi> came up to <hi>Judea,</hi> which lay higher, yet it was not then accompliſhed; for neither did there at that time any ſuch number of <hi>Iſrael</hi> come up, nor can <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> be <hi>the head</hi> appointed here, but only Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37.24, 25.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114928:18"/>
21, 22, 25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord have now for a long time rejected the body of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and filled their room with <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the branches of the wilde Olive; yet his gifts and calling toward them, are without repentance, as doth appear in his reſervation of a ſpecial portion of Goſpel-bleſſings for them, as this Promiſe holds forth. 2. The ſalvation promiſed to the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the dayes of the Goſpel, is not peculiar to the <hi>Jewes</hi> only, who were rejected for their crucifying of Chriſt, but common to <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo, who ſhall be converted and made again one body with <hi>Judah,</hi> after all the rents that have been betwixt them, ſince their defection from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and their corrupting of Religion: For, <hi>The children of Iudah, and the children of Iſrael ſhall be gathered together;</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. 3. The day is coming, wherein all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall acknowledge the true Meſſiah, when <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall look unto him whom they have peirced, and mourn, and embrace him; and when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall embrace him for their King, and the true Son and Heire of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> from whom they have made ſo foule defection, and in him ſhall they be united: For, he is that <hi>one head,</hi> in embracing of whom they ſhall be converted, and in whom they ſhall be united. 4. As union amongſt the people of God, is a choice Goſpel-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, conſidering (among other things,) the violence of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Brethren; So, true union needs never be expected, but where Chriſt is made our Head, with whom communion is holden, and ſet up as a King to governe, and men are not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to walk after their own imaginations: This general inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be gathered from this particular inſtance, <hi>Iudah and Iſrael ſhall be gathered together,</hi> their union after ſo great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is a great mercy, and they attain to it when they have <hi>one head.</hi> 5. Albeit Chriſt be a King ſet by his Father over <hi>Zion, Pſal.</hi> 2.6. yet it is the duty and priviledge of the Church, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to embrace, and acknowledge, and ſubmit unto him: Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>they ſhall appoint themſelves one head.</hi> 6. The happineſſe of choiceſt Goſpel-times, conſiſts not ſo much in what the people of God enjoy for preſent, as in their moving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward their heavenly reſt, joyning themſelves to the Church, that they may have the uſe of means for that end; and a time of love will make difficulties in the way eaſie, and looſe the bonds of earthly affections, or ſpiritual ſlavery wherein men are held, or retarded by them; So much doth this promiſe ſpiritually under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, teach, <hi>they ſhall come up out of the land;</hi> See <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. 7. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall be converted, the Lord will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114928:19"/>
his Covenant, and reſtore them to their promiſed privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; and in particular, there will not only be converts of them ſcattered here and there among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but their converſion will be accompanied with the recollection of them as a Nation, and (as would appear) with a reſtitution of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and bringing them back to their land: So much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be in this promiſe, <hi>They ſhall be gathered together, and they ſhall come up out of the land,</hi> as is before explained: And this is the tenour of the Covenant with them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 8. Whatever be the difficulties of the children of God in their journey toward Heaven, or may be the trials of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their converſion; yet herein is ground of comfort, that they are under Chriſt their Head, who hath influence to aſſiſt and refreſh them, and power to protect and ſupport them: For, they <hi>ſhall appoint themſelves one head, and they ſhall come up out of the land;</hi> See <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                     <p>As for that reaſon ſubjoyned in the end of the <hi>ver. For,</hi> (or <hi>becauſe,</hi> or <hi>albeit) great ſhall be the day of Jezreel;</hi> If we take <hi>Jezreel,</hi> to ſignifie, <hi>the ſcattered of the Lord,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 4. the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be, as if the Lord ſaid, becauſe there will be ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day of <hi>Iezreel,</hi> therefore I will make it up by this reſtitution; as indeed in a time of love, his compaſſion floweth out the more abundantly, as calamities have been ſad and unſupportable, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.20, 21. or it may be taken thus, Albeit there hath been ſuch a great day of <hi>Jezreel,</hi> yet this mercy ſhall alſo come to paſſe; neither the irreparableneſſe of his ſtroak, nor his anger inflicting it ſhall make his promiſe of mercy void. But we may as well here take <hi>Jezreel</hi> for <hi>the ſeed of God,</hi> as it is alluded to Chap. 2.23. to intimate (by way of confirmation of the promiſe,) that as ſeed when it is ſowne in the ground, doth hereby multiplie, and bring forth increaſe; ſo they being encreaſed and multiplied in their diſperſion, it ſhould make the day of their recollection, to be a great and remarkable day. And it teacheth, 1. In a time of love, the Lord can and will turn his peoples hardeſt lots into mercies; <hi>Jezreel</hi> ſcattered of the Lord, becomes <hi>Jezreel</hi> the ſeed of the Lord. 2. Dayes of the Lords manifeſting mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his people, are indeed great dayes, and worth the marking, as affording mercies above any mercies beſide; For, ſuch a day ſhall be <hi>a great day.</hi> 3. As all the times wherein God is kinde to his people, are remarkable times; ſo in particular, a time of his love after ſad calamities, his bringing forth the fruits of their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114928:19"/>
afflictions, and of his love after a long interruption, will make a refreſhful time: whereof the ſtate of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be a clear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the time of whoſe converſion will be a remarkable and glorious time: For, <hi>great ſhall be the day of Jezreel,</hi> when God ſhall regard them as his ſeed after their ſcattering, and make them encreaſe thereby.</p>

In times of greateſt defection of a viſible Church, the Lord may, and doth keep unto himſelf a remnant, for whoſe ſake he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth his preſence with a corrupt Church, or they prove wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for him, and theſe to whom he will be good, however it go with the body of the Church; For, ſo is imported here, there are <hi>brethren and ſiſters</hi> to plead, which can never be underſtood of the Church, which was to be in the dayes of the Goſpel, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.10, 11. as if they were brought in by the Lord, to ſhame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Iſrael</hi> from her whoredomes, nor yet of <hi>Judah</hi> called unto to plead with <hi>Iſrael;</hi> For, the preſent Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not be called <hi>a mother</hi> to either of theſe: But it is to be taken of a remnant among themſelves at that ſame time; See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. 2. The great priviledges of the truly godly is, that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges offered to the viſible Church, are enſured to them, even when ſhe is rejected; And in particular, that they have intereſt in God as his peculiar people: which as it floweth from Gods free mercy allanerly; ſo it proves the Fountain of much mercy, and tender dealing toward them; So much may be gathered from their names, <hi>Ammi,</hi> or <hi>my people,</hi> and <hi>Ruhamah,</hi> or <hi>having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy,</hi> which names are given to them, when the body of the people are (for preſent, or ſhortly to be) <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> and <hi>Lo-ruhamah,</hi> Chap. 1.6, 9. Yet it would be conſidered, that we are not to look on theſe names as to be given, one to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the other to the ſiſters only; but both of them as common to both, though becauſe of the Original conſtruction they be thus diſtributed. 3. It is the duty of the godly to be much in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114928:20"/>
cheriſhing mutual love among themſelves, eſpecially in times of general defection, and of approaching calamities; Therefore are they deſigned as <hi>brethren and ſiſters</hi> one to another. 4. It is the commendation of the truly godly in an ill time, to be careful of others and of the publick good; and when their ſenſe of their great priviledges, and of Godstender mercies toward them, makes them compaſſionate and active for the publick weal of the Church, in their ſtations; So much is imported in the charge laid on <hi>Ammi</hi> and <hi>Ruhamah,</hi> in reference to their Mother-Church. 5. Whatever be the activity of the godly in their duty, yet they need upſtirring by the Miniſtery of the Word, and to be mutual encouragers and ſharpeners one of another, eſpecially in declining times, when duty may be full of hazard, ſucceſſe, hopeleſſe, and themſelves under ſome degrees of the ſpiritual plagues of the time: For, this exhortation, <hi>Say ye to your brethren, &amp;c.</hi> imports not only that it is their duty which is here given them in charge, ſay it who will unto them, but that <hi>Hoſea</hi> and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets are to ſay it to them; and that they are to ſay it one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. 6. As a Church may be very far declining, and yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it with fair pretences, excuſes and juſtifications, requiring that ſhe ſhould be <hi>pleaded</hi> with, to put her from them; So it is the duty of every true childe of God, to plead for him and his truth againſt all, even if it were a whole Church, and <hi>to plead with their mother,</hi> or the body of the Nation, who were a viſible Church, and brought them forth to God: And they are bound to inſiſt in this duty without diſcouragement, though they be alone, and a Church againſt them, and albeit they ſeem to have no ſucceſſe; Therefore is the exhortation doubled, <hi>plead with your mother, plead.</hi> 7. Open pleading for God againſt a Church, is then lawful in private perſons, when not only they have truth on their ſide, and have eſſayed other more peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means before, but in vain: But more eſpecially when the corruption pleaded againſt, is Idolatry ſtriking at the marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſhe <hi>is not my wife,</hi> as to the merit of her way, which is here given for the reaſon of their pleading; and when ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, though faulty, with reverence, and as a mother, <hi>plead with your mother,</hi> yet as with a mother. And if ſhe was to be ſo dealt with, ſo long as God gave her not a bill of divorce, though an harlot, how much more is it required, when faults reproveable are nothing ſuch? This would make men in acquitting of their conſciences, mourne more, and be more orderly, and leſſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent. 8. It is no ſure ground for a viſible Church to reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114928:21"/>
that ſhe hath once given up her name to God, and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him, unleſſe ſhe alſo perſevere: ſeeing a viſible Church may decline ſo far as to make void the marriage-Covenant on her part, and to deſerve rejection, and a bill of divorce. Of this the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is a ſad and evident inſtance, <hi>ſhe is not my wife,</hi> her carriage was ſuch as became not a wife, <hi>neither am I her husband,</hi> that is, ſhe deſerves to be rejected, though as yet the bill of divorce be not given. 9. Such is the long-ſuffering patience of God, as that he doth not at firſt give up with a Church, even when her diſeaſe is deſperate, but by contending with her, calls her to amendment, upon which there is a door of hope left open; Therefore doth he ſubjoyne this to the challenge, as his ſcope in it, <hi>Let her therefore put away her whoredomes and adulteries:</hi> and it is only upon neglect of this that the ſentence cometh forth, <hi>v.</hi> 3. 10 God will not accept of fair underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings from a declining Church, but he requireth that her Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be reall, and eſpecially of idolatry and corrupting of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and his worſhip; for, ſaith he, <hi>let her put away her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, &amp;c.</hi> 11. God requireth of his declining Church, that ſhe be ſenſible of the ill of her activity in idolatrous worſhip and of her own impudence in following it, and that ſhe renounce it with deteſtation; for, ſaith he, <hi>let her put her whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes out of her ſight,</hi> or, <hi>from her face,</hi> and her <hi>adulteries from between her breaſts,</hi> alluding to the pompe and open impudence of harlots, who paint their face and deck their breaſts, and make them bare, to follow filthineſſe and to engage and allure others: See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.33. This ſhe is to be ſo ſenſible of, as <hi>to put them out of her ſight,</hi> or to have them ſo in abomination, as ſhe cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to look on them: See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.22. 12. This ſimilitude; pointing at the practice of idolaters, by the carriage of lewd harlots, teacheth that the Lord abhorreth painting and laſcivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous decking of the body, and that the practicers thereof cannot be free of whoredome in the ſight of God; for <hi>whoredome</hi> is in <hi>their face,</hi> and <hi>adultery between their breaſts.</hi>

The judgements threatened againſt her ſelfe, are held out under many ſimilitudes, 1. Of an adulterous wife, ſpoiled of all her ornaments, and ſet naked as when ſhe was born; whereby is ſignified the depriving her of all ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral favours, which ſhe enjoyed by vertue of the Covenant, and leaving her as he found her, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 59. &amp; 23, 26, 29. 2. Of a deſolate and barren drie land, ſignifying, that ſhe who was as a watered garden, ſhould become as a wilderneſſe, and as a land wanting moiſture, both in her ſpiritual eſtate, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward enjoyments. 3. Of a traveller, who being caſt into a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary wilderneſſe, is ſlain through want of drink and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſo ſhould ſhe be left under ſcorching wrath, and deſtitute of all comfort in her extremities. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However the Lord may for a time ſpare ſinners, and they be ready to ſleep, becauſe of this; yet at laſt when their cup is full, and they have proven themſelves incorrigible, judgement will certainly come; ſo much doth this certification ſubjoyned to the exhortation, teach us. 2. However a carnal Church may be ready to ſwell with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of her own enjoyments and excellencies; yet the Lord needs no more to make her miſerable, but take away what he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her, and leave her as he found her: and he will do ſo to the incorrigible; <hi>I will ſtrip her naked, and ſet her as in the day that ſhe was born.</hi> 3.

It is the great and inſupportable miſery of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, that their guilt doth leave them deſtitute of ſuccour or comfort, in their greateſt extremity, to be conſumed thereby; therefore doth he adde, <hi>and ſlay her with thirſt.</hi> 5. As particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members of a Church do ordinarily runne wrong with her, when ſhe in her Rulers or Judicatores, doth decline, ſo however ſuch may think to eſcape, when the Church or body of the Nation whereof the Church conſiſts, is brought into bondage, or deſtroyed in their powers, and want the face of a Church; yet God purſuing for ſinne, will not only break a Nation, but cauſe judgements reach particular perſons alſo; for, the children of this mother <hi>be the children of whoredomes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are threatened alſo. 6.

                     <p>To clear the equity of this ſentence, the Lord doth repeat their ſinne, in ſad challenges, and the judgements deſerved by it, in ſharp threatenings. Their ſinne may be comprehended in this general, of their idolatry in, and becauſe of their proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but ſince the Lord doth branch it out in ſeveral chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges, and ſubjoynes threatenings to every one of them, I ſhall follow it in that method.</p>
                     <p>The firſt branch of the challenge, is, that in her proſperity ſhe would follow the idolatry of the calves, and her confederates and their idols, becauſe ſhe thought they upheld her, and were the cauſe of her proſperity, and ſo followed any courſe which might bring her profit and pleaſure. This the Lord challengeth, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſimple whoredome, which may be done in the dark, but avowed, effronted adultery. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such is the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of groſſeſt ſinners, that they neither ſee the ill nor danger of their way, unleſſe it be much and frequently inculcate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Lord inſiſt ſo much again upon both, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes this challenge to the former ſentence, with the particle <hi>for,</hi> that he may yet let her ſee how juſtly he accuſed her as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not his wife, and threatened her becauſe of that, <hi>For their mother hath played the Harlot.</hi> 2. A viſible Church declining, will readily turne impudent in ſinne, in regard, the more corruption hath been hemmed in by the external bonds of order, it ſwells the more over all banks and bounds; and God juſtly giveth ſuch
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114928:22"/>
up to be filled with their own devices; for not only <hi>hath the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther played the harlot,</hi> but <hi>ſhe that conceived them, hath done ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> and impudently, which may alſo be imported in her <hi>going after her lovers,</hi> or purſuing of them, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16 33, 34. 3. It is a great aggravation of the ſinne of idolatry, that idols do become lovers, and do bewitch and draw the heart from God; Therefore doth ſhe call (not only her confederates, by joyning with whom ſhe thought to proſper, but chiefly) her idols <hi>my lovers,</hi> in regard they drew her heart from God. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.38. 4. As it is a great ſinne to depart from God and his true worſhip; ſo eſpecially it is a ſhamefull way of departing from him, when mens ends are ſo low and baſe, that they will follow any way of Religion for intereſt and advantage, and account the thriving way beſt; for, herein did ſhe ſhamefully, that ſhe went <hi>after her lovers,</hi> and why? <hi>they give me my bread, and my water, my wool and my flax, &amp;c.</hi> ſhe thought ſhe thrave beſt in and becauſe of her idolatry. Albeit it was her miſtake and ſinne to father her proſperity ſo, as we will finde, <hi>v.</hi> 8. yet ſuppoſing it had been as ſhe ſaid, it was ſtill her great ſinne to make that the rule whereby to trie true Religion, and not to love the way of God, whatever diſadvantage followed. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. 5. It is alſo a great evidence of impudence, when men do not ſinne through infirmity or tentation, but deliberately, and do wilfully follow their reſolutions, whatever be ſaid to the contrary; for, herein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhe did ſhamefully, in that <hi>ſhe ſaid, I will go after my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, &amp;c.</hi> She avowed it, and was obſtinate in it againſt all warnings.

And if that ſhould not yet reclaime her, but ſhe would obſtinately follow Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, as hoping yet to proſper in it, he threatens ſtill to diſappoint her, till ſhe ſhould renounce them, and turn to him, confeſſing ſhe had fated the worſe for leaving him, <hi>v.</hi> 7. As for this effect of her affliction and diſappointments, albeit this far it might be true of the wicked, that affliction may let them ſee, and convince them of their folly in forſaking God, as we finde the body of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> convinced of the truth of Gods Word, which they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.6 yet taking this prediction altogether, it holds out their true converſion, which was verified in the Elect among them, and will be more conſpicuous, when that Nation ſhall turn to the Lord. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Where God is not acknowledged in proſperity, not looked upon as the giver of it; he will be ſeen in adverſity, and prove himſelf God, by overturning theſe reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein men have never ſo much of will; Therefore in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their miſtake and wilfulneſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 5. he ſubjoynes, <hi>Therefore behold, I will hedge up her way, &amp;c.</hi> Though ſhe ſhould follow her lovers he will croſſe her way; though ſhe ſaw not him as the giver of proſperity, he will be remakably ſeen in removing it. 2. It is righteous with God, that nothing that draweth the Churches heart from him, ſhould proſper in her hand; and it ſpeaks mercy, if well emproven, when the way of ſin is made difficult to a people: Therefore, becauſe proſperity drew her away, he threatens to remove it, and to <hi>hedge up her way with thornes, and make a wall, that ſhe ſhall not finde her paths,</hi> that is, to make her have a bitter and difficult time of it, while ſhe adheres to Idolatry, and all this in order to her reclaiming. 3. Albeit afflictions from the Lord ſhould point out ſin, and prove as hedges and walls to hem us in it from it; yet of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and without the grace and bleſſing of God, they will never diſcover ſin, nor change our natur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114928:23"/>
ſhe would reckon the only way to be freed of them, were to follow Idols more. 4. Sin (and particularly Idolatry) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh very enſnaring and entangling, where it is given way unto; and albeit men may be allured to it by reaſon of proſperity, which ſeemeth to attend it; yet it begets ſuch a ſtiffe-neck, as affliction will not drive from it: For, though ſhe followed her lovers for bread and water, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 5. yet now when her way is hedged up, ſhe will not abandon them; <hi>She ſhall follow after her lovers.</hi> She will digeſt more affliction in a wrong way, then in cleaving to God: Affliction will eaſily make her ſtumble at the true Religion, but will not drive her from Idolatry. 5. It is juſt with God, the more eager that men be on ſin, and on advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, to let them meet with the moe diſappointments; and he will do ſo eſpecially where he hath a purpoſe of love toward any; For, ſaith he, <hi>She ſhall follow after her lovers, but ſhall not overtake them, and ſhe ſhall ſeek them, but ſhall not finde them;</hi> that is, ſhe ſhall reap no expected advantage by multiplying I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries under affliction; and this the Lord doth that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime her. 6. As turning unto God and his way, is the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſed fruit of affliction, ſo even ſuch as have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible in Idolatry, and become the worſe of many rods, God can yet bleſſe affliction, to reclaime them: For, ſo much doth he undertake for <hi>Iſrael</hi> at laſt, <hi>then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and returne.</hi> 7. Even Apoſtate Idolaters when they repent, are allowed to lay hold on God as heirs, and on the relation of an husband, as ſtanding ſtill in force, to encourage them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſhe allowed to ſay, I <hi>will return to my firſt husband,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>firſt,</hi> in relation to many Idols whom ſhe had put in the place of husbands ſince God chooſed her, though they were not huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands indeed.

Such as embrace God and his way, would take him up as the beſt of choices; and his way, as the ſhorteſt cut to do well and be well: and would be ſenſible of their own diſadvantages by forſaking him: So much is import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reaſon of her return, <hi>for then was it better with me then now:</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14.3.</p>

The Lord is very liberal to his own, keeping his way, when it is for their good; and he doth not at firſt withdraw his bounty in their declining, that thereby he may reclaime them: For, <hi>He gave her corne, and wine, and multiplied her ſilver and gold,</hi> even after her begun A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy 2. God manifeſts much kindneſſe whereof little notice is taken, and wherein his hand is not ſeen nor acknowledged, and this is ground of a ſad challenge: For, here the Lord challengeth, <hi>She did not know that I gave her corne and wine, &amp;c.</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged her Idols for it, <hi>v</hi> 5. 3. Much light will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to ſinners their duty, or the ill of their way, but they will either remain groſſely ignorant, or will affect ignorance, and not ponder what they know; For, albeit this was the Church who might be abundantly informed and convinced that all things were of God; yet <hi>ſhe did not know it,</hi> ſhe was groſſely and affected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant. 4. Where God is not ſeen nor acknowledged in mens proſperity, it is a ſure token they will employ it ill, and to his diſhonour; For, ſo did they here, <hi>they prepared it for Baal.</hi>

                     <p>The laſt branch of the challenge, (and the height of all the ſin formerly challenged,) is for her Idolatry, particularly of <hi>Baal,</hi> which ſhe followed with much ſumptuouſneſſe, forgetting God; For this the Lord threatens in due time to puniſh. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The capeſtone and height of ſin, and abuſe of mercy in the viſible Church, is Idolatry, when all her care is to ſet up a falſe Religion, and to uphold it by her proſperity: and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, when not only the true God is worſhipped in a wrong way, but when an Idol is ſet up to be the object of worſhip; This is the ſubſtance of all the former challenges, her <hi>burning incenſe to Baalim,</hi> (or ſeveral Idols under that name, or that ſame Idol under ſeveral ſhapes in diverſe places,) and <hi>going after her lovers.</hi> 2. Such as admit of one ſtep of Idolatry, may be given up to more; and ſuch as ſet up their own devices in worſhipping the true God, are juſtly given up to take an Idol in his room, and would do ſo, if they had a tentation: For, they who at firſt worſhipped the calves, do now embrace <hi>Baalim.</hi> 3. Idolatry is a way to which our hearts incline by nature, and much external pomp is no evidence of a true Religion: For, <hi>ſhe burnt incenſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114928:26"/>
to them, and decked her ſelf with her eare-rings and her Jewels, and ſhe went after her lovers:</hi> Her pomp and ſuperfluity in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding that Idolatry, (as an harlots decking when ſhe proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes her ſelf,) declared the inclination of her heart, and this pomp proclaimed the unſoundneſſe of that way. 4. As Idolatry in the viſible Church proclaimeth great forgetfulneſſe of God, what he is in himſelf, and hath been unto them; So the Lord will take notice of this as an aggravatiun of that ſin: Therefore is it added, <hi>and forgat me, ſaith the LORD;</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6, 7, 15, 16. 5.

                     <p>The firſt ground of conſolation, or promiſe in this <hi>ver.</hi> hath three branches, 1. It being ſuppoſed in the former threatenings, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> is rejected for ſin, and driven in exile, and under bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, as when they were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> (to which the alluſion is;) The Lord promiſeth, even when ſhe is in that condition, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure and perſwade her by the voice of the Goſpel, and efficacy of his Spirit, to turn to him, and come out of her ſpiritual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to follow him; which anſwers to their call out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Hoſ</hi> 11.1. 2. As <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114928:26"/>
after their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> were brought into a wilderneſſe, where they <hi>were made to walk</hi> long, (as the word here will read,) amidſt many difficulties, and yet as their journey toward <hi>Canaan,</hi> wherein they were ſupported and provided for; ſo he promiſeth that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after their converſion to God, ſhould walk on through the wilderneſſe of this world, toward their heavenly <hi>Canaan;</hi> or more particularly, it may relate to ſome great difficulties convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iſrael</hi> may meet with before their recollection from exile, and in their bringing up from the land of the North, <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14, 15. 3. He promiſeth, that in this their wandering through the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, he will ſpeak comfortably to their heart; which anſwers to the entring in Covenant with them; and the many proofes of love they met with during their fourty years pilgrimage. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As a viſible Church may become ſo deſperately ſick, as there is no remedying of her, but by utter undoing of her for a time, (as here it is ſuppoſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be;) ſo free-grace in God may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſuch incorrigibleneſſe, and ſuch an undone conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to manifeſt and magnifie it ſelf upon her, and unto her, even to admiration; Therefore do theſe promiſes come in with a <hi>Therefore</hi> by way of concluſion upon the former purpoſe, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſince they had given a proof what they could do, and that there was no other remedy, but they would be undone for ever; therefore he would take occaſion of this to manifeſt what grace could make of ſuch a deſperate caſe and people. And this hath a <hi>behold</hi> prefixed to it, as being indeed admirable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable. 2. Converſion to God, is the great proof of the love of God toward ſinners, and the firſt ſtep to their happineſſe; and it will be the way of God with <hi>Iſrael</hi> to turn them to him, before they taſte of any other fruit of the Covenant, and while they are yet in exile: For, <hi>I will allure her,</hi> or <hi>perſwade her,</hi> is the firſt promiſe. The forme of ſpeech alludes in part, to what their idols did of old, they did allure them away from God, now the Lord ſhall outbid all their lovers, and gain their heart from them: and to the Lords dealing with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> after <hi>Iſrae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114928:27"/>
ſweet voice of the Goſpel, and his allurements and offers ſo ſweet and rich, ſo that the ſoul is made moſt willing in this choice; So much may be gathered from this deſcription of converſion, <hi>I will allure her,</hi> or gain her heart to my ſelf by the ſweet allurements of the Goſpel. 4. Such as are converted to Chriſt, ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolve on a journey and progreſſe, as having more before them, both of duty and exerciſe, and of enjoyments; For, after ſhe is <hi>allured,</hi> ſhe is to remove and come to a <hi>wilderneſſe,</hi> whether we underſtand it of the godlies progreſſe toward Heaven, or <hi>Iſraels</hi> in particular toward her wonted enjoyments. 5. As unto the converted, the world and all things therein, will look with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face; and whereas they looked on it as their reſt, they will now ſee it to be but the place of their ſojourning and pilgrimage; What they accounted a Paradiſe, they will judge but a <hi>wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> and that which ſmiled upon them, as being of the world, will now frowne upon them: So in particular, it may pleaſe the Lord, after the converſion of his people, to bring them into ſad troubles and exerciſes for their uſe and profit; For, as he did ſo to <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old after their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo he will do to <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their converſion, <hi>I will allure her, and bring her to the wilderneſſe.</hi> Such a lot as this ſerveth to ſtir up yet more to repentance, is the way to true reſt, and fits them for it, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> found of old; See <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.15, 16. 6. Whatever may be the lot of the Lords converted people, yet it is their advantage that they are in his hand and guiding, who as his ſweet allurements and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts may invite any to follow him, though it were even to a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe; ſo his carving out of their lot, and going before them, and being with them in it, will render even the ſaddeſt of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and eaſie; For, ſo is imported here, it is upon his <hi>allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> ſhe followeth him, and <hi>he brings her to the wilderneſſe,</hi> which is her mercy. 7. When the Lord brings his people into a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe-condidition, it is out of a purpoſe of love to them, that it may endeer them to his heart, may make way for, and render them capable of much mercy and many proofes of love; For, when he <hi>brings her to the wilderneſſe,</hi> he <hi>ſpeaketh comfortably to her,</hi> or deals kindly with her.

                     <p>The ſecond ground of conſolation, (wherein he inſiſts in the alluſion to their coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>) is, that as of old <hi>Iſrael</hi> had an end put to their toile in the wilderneſſe, and got the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a fruitful land, (here ſignified by vineyards, a part for the whole;) and as they at firſt entred into the poſſeſſion of that fruitful valley near <hi>Jericho,</hi> as a pledge of their future ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, and of the fertility of their land: So the Lord will put an end to his peoples toile and wandering, by giving them compleat reſt in Heaven, or particular deliverances from particular troubles within time; and more particularly, <hi>Iſraels</hi> toile after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, ſhall end in reſtitution to wonted enjoyments, and (as would appear) to their land, which will be made fruitful to them; And further, till this full enjoyment come, he will give unto them ſuch beginnings and taſtes of his bounty, as may be a pledge and ground of hope of getting more. This promiſe is amplified from an effect, that Gods bounty ſhould make them rejoyce and ſing, as of old at the red Sea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.1, <hi>&amp;c. Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord will comfort his people, not only with ample promiſes, but in due time alſo with real effects of his love in performing promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; Therefore is this promiſe ſubjoyned to the former of <hi>ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfortably, v.</hi> 14. 2. The Lord can, and will make the troubles of his reconciled people have a notable end, and reſtore them to their enjoyments which were loſt, by reaſon of ſin: For, <hi>I will give her, her vineyards from thence;</hi> albeit theſe were cut off for ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 12. yet now they are recovered, and they are given

                        <hi>from thence,</hi> or, from the wilderneſſe, out of which they entered into the poſſeſſion of theſe. 3. Albeit the Lord do not at firſt ſatisfie his peoples expectations and deſires, nor give them all he promiſeth, when he begins to appear for them; yet he will not faile to let out pledges of his love, which may ſupport them, and be a pledge of what is coming, and whereof they ſhould make uſe for that end: For, he will give them <hi>the valley of Acho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> (of which, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.24, 25, 26) and that <hi>for a door of hope,</hi> as diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering ground of hoping for more, and allowing them to do ſo, as 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.12. This valley (though it got the name from <hi>Achans</hi> troubling them, yet) was a door of hope, becauſe it was the firſt place they poſſeſſed after they paſſed over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and was given them as a pledge of poſſeſſing the whole. And the fruitfulneſſe thereof, (of which, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.10) was a pledge to them what the whole land ſhould prove: Thus the godly have the Spirit as the earneſt of their inheritance, and ſome help from ſome ſtraits as a pledge of the ſweet iſſue of all of them; and converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be reſtored to ſome beginnings of Gods wonted bounty, aſſuring them of more. 4. The Lords dealing with his reconciled peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is ſuch as will furniſh them cauſe of joy, and the Lord will refreſh them by it; For, it is his promiſe, <hi>ſhe ſhall ſing.</hi> 5. Not only ought Gods people to rejoyce when all things are performed according to promiſes, but (beſide what is required of glorying in tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3.) when the Lord gives any pledge of his love, or begun evidences of it, they ought to cheriſh it by joy and praiſe, though full fruition be wanting; For, even <hi>there,</hi> on the border of her wilderneſſe, in the valley of <hi>Achor, ſhe ſhall ſing.</hi> 6. The Lords ancient kindneſſe, and the Churches joy of old, is recorded in Scripture as a pledge of what ſhe may yet expect, when ſhe is reconciled to God; and the joy of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their converſion, ſhall come behinde with no ſong that at any time they have had; For, <hi>ſhe ſhall ſing as in the dayes of her youth,</hi> (that is, in the day when he firſt married her, and entered in Covenant with her, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.2, 3 <hi>Exek.</hi> 16.60. and ſo it is expounded in the following words,) <hi>and as in the day when ſhe came up out of the Land of Egypt.</hi> 7. That vocal ſinging to the Lords praiſe, is a Goſpel-ordinance, may appear in part from this place, wherein it is promiſed as a Goſpel-practice, and the practice of converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall ſing</hi> as of old at the Red-Sea: Though mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical inſtruments and dances, (which wera uſed then alſo,) are aboliſhed, as being ceremonial.</p>

                     <p>The third ground of conſolation, is held out in a promiſe of through reformation, making them ſo to cleave to God in the exerciſe of the true Religion, as they ſhall renounce all corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even the very names that had been abuſed to Idolatry. And this the Lord himſelf undertakes to effectuate, and to root out I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols. Albeit the names <hi>Baali,</hi> and <hi>Iſhi,</hi> ſignifie both of them <hi>an husband,</hi> (though the firſt ſignifie chiefly an husband under the notion of authority, and the other of love,) And albeit <hi>Baali</hi> might be ſaid of God, as for any thing in it ſelf, as it is <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5. yet ſince it had been abuſed and given to Idols, he will have it no more uſed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord delivereth and is kinde to his people, it is their duty to prove their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, by embracing of Chriſt, and cleaving to him and his pure ſervice and by zeal in Reformation, and deliverance is then bleſſed, when this accompanieth it: Therefore is this promiſe ſubjoyned to the former. 2. The Lord will be unto his people what a faithful husband is unto his wife, and they are allowed to expect, and in the faith thereof, to profeſſe and avow him in the exerciſe of true Reſigion; For, <hi>thou ſhalt call me Iſhi,</hi> or avow me for thy husband, as thou art warranted to do. 3. The Lord is ſo tender of the matter of his worſhip and ſervice, that he will allow no mixture in it, nor halting betwixt it and Idolatry; yea, not ſo much as names of Idols are to be remembered with their worſhipping of him, nor an abuſed name to be made uſe of in his religious worſhip; For, <hi>thou ſhalt call me no more Baali,</hi> nor uſe that name, though in my ſervice, and <hi>the names of Baalim,</hi> muſt be <hi>taken away out of her mouth, and they no more remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their name,</hi> to wit, in any Religious State eſpecially.

he will ſo do to his people, and in particular to <hi>Iſrael</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: For, it is a promiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me Iſhi, &amp;c. for I will take away the names of Baalim, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>The fourth ground of conſolation, is outward peace; Gods favour and Covenant ſhall ſecure them from hurt by any of the creatures, as if a Covenant were made with them for that effect; and ſhall give them peace, and ſecurity from warres. As for the extent of this promiſe, we may compare what is obſerved on <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.3, 4. It ſeemeth to have a ſpecial relation unto the ſtate of converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of which, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.8. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. All the creatures of God are juſtly at enmity with man, and armed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, ſo long as he is not reconciled with God their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: So much may be gathered from this promiſe following on their reconciliation. 2. Reconciliation with God brings peace with all the creatures, ſo far as is for the reconciled mans good, though there muſt be an exception of needful trial; and however, none of them ſhall marre his true peace and happineſſe; So much is held ont in this promiſe, <hi>I will make a covenant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground;</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 5.23. 3. That which ſecureth the godly man from trouble from the creatures, is Gods dominion over all of them, who can enſure his peoples tranquillity for them; For, ſaith he, <hi>I will make a Covenant for them, &amp;c.</hi> that is, not only ſend this mercy to them by vertue of the Covenant, (which makes it ſweet) but makes it as ſure, by reaſon of his dominion, as if there were an expreſſe Covenant for that effect. 4. As peace and deliverance from war is a great bleſſing; So it is the Lord only who puts an end to war, and giveth peace: For, <hi>I will break the bowe, and the ſword, and the battel,</hi> (that is, all other inſtruments of war, or the war it ſelf acted by theſe weapons, which is broken, when the weapons are
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114928:29"/>
broken,) <hi>out of the earth;</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 47.6, 7. 5. When a people ſtudie reconciliation with God, and are cordial in following a through Reformation, they arr in Gods way for attaining out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace; For, it is upon the accompliſhment of the former promiſes, and particularly that, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. that this promiſe followeth, <hi>In that day I will break the bowe, &amp;c.</hi> otherwiſe it may be ſaid as <hi>Jehu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joram,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings.</hi> 9.22. See <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.8. 6. When the Lord hath given peace, it is he only who muſt maintain it, and can give quietneſſe of minde to make people enjoy quietneſſe and tranquillity by it; For, it is a new promiſe, <hi>I will make them to lie down ſafely,</hi> or <hi>in confidence.</hi> Unleſſe he give peace, outward tranquillity will not afford it; and if he give that, we have no cauſe to complain, though we be in the midſt of trouble.</p>

                     <p>The fifth ground of conſolation, and fountain of all theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, is the renewing of the Marriage-covenant with them: which becauſe they had turned it of old into a Covenant of Works to themſelves, and had been plagued for the breach of it; Therfore he promiſeth now to renew it on ſuch tearmes, as ſhould make it ſure and comfortable. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever may be Gods dealing at firſt with his own people whom he calleth, yet his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them imports, and tends to an advancing of them to a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-communion with himſelf, whereby they are made one with him, and reap the fruits of this conjunction in communication of eſtates, and much love to them; For, <hi>I will betroth thee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi> ſaith he; and it is called <hi>betrothing,</hi> not only becauſe his affection continues ſtill freſh, as of new betrothed perſons, but becauſe our enjoyments here, are but as a betrothing in order to a Marriage to be conſumnat in Heaven, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.7. 2. The Lords renewing his Covenant with his penitent people, after their backſlidings, will be without any upbraiding of them for
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114928:30"/>
former debordings, whereof now they are aſhamed; For, his covenanting with converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is not a taking her again as an adulterous and divorced wife, but a <hi>betrothing</hi> of her as a pure Virgin. 3. Albeit there may be many viciſſitudes betwixt Chriſt and his confederate people, as to their conditions, his diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and manifeſtations; yet the Marriage-tie will remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable for ever: And thr Covenant being renewed with <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a Natton, will endure for ever, for the good of the Elect among them; For, <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever,</hi> It is ſo well ordered that it muſt be ſure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, —34. 4. As for the firſt propertie of the Marriage-Covenant, that it is <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> it may import that this bargain ſhall be made and performed in reality, and not in ſhew only, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.41. (for thus Gods <hi>righteouſneſſe</hi> ſeemeth to be taken for his integrity in promiſing, and his reality and conſtancy in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what he undertakes, as <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.9. and is the ſame with that <hi>uprightneſſe,</hi> and oppoſite to that <hi>unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> of which, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.15.) But it ſeemes to hold out yet more concerning this Covenant, that God will communicate the imputed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt, to the confederate, whereby he ſhall ſtand in Covenant for ever, nothing being to be objected againſt him, but what is abundantly anſwered and ſatisfied in his Cautioner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. And that the Lord by doing this, ſhall do them good <hi>in righteouſneſſe,</hi> as being ſatisfied in his Son, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. and without any imputation to his righteouſneſſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt ſin, having received ſuch a ranſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. 5. The ſecond property <hi>(in judgement)</hi> teacheth, 1. That as for his confederate people, the Lord will have a tender reſpect and conſideration what they are, and what their mould is with whom he makes the bargain; and therefore will not caſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for after-failings, ſeeing he knew what they would prove whom he chooſed, and he will moderate his dealing with them, as conſidering what they are able to bear: This diſcreet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and moderating of diſpenſations is held out under the name of <hi>judgement,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.4. and elſewhere. Secondly, it teacheth, that as for enemies, he will not faile to execute venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on theſe of them who are incorrigible, and will right all wrongs done to her; Thus <hi>judgement</hi> is frequently taken in Scripture. 6. The third property (<hi>in loving kindneſſe,</hi> or <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> or <hi>bounty</hi>) teacheth, that the Lord will not only keep Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant becauſe he is tied; but as of his love and bounty, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in Covenant, ſo he will conſtantly delight in the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114928:30"/>
as a Bridegroom in his Bride, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.17. he will do them good freely and bountifully, will be eaſie to be intreated, and anſwer all objections that can be moved, with his own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and love. 7. The fourth property, (<hi>in mercies,</hi> or <hi>bowels</hi>) teacheth, that as the confederate will be far from perfection, and will daily need much compaſſion, both as to his ſin and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries following upon it, and yet be confederate for all that: So the Covenant doth enſure unto him the tender bowels of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, to ſympathize with him in his afflictions, and graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pardon acknowledged and repented of guilt; and that there ſhall be many, even <hi>bowels</hi> of them, to anſwer to the greatneſſe of his ſin or trouble, and his frequent falling in the one or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 8. The fifth property, <hi>(in faithfulneſſe)</hi> if we take it more generally for firmneſſe and ſtability, and real <hi>truth</hi> of a thing, (as it is, when joyned with mercy, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.3.) it teacheth, that however there be many impoſſible like things promiſed in the Covenant, and all of it depending on free-mercy; and however the confederate may be oft-times ready to faile, and doth faile on his part; yet conſidering the fidelity of God, and that he undertakes for both parties, it ſhall prove a firme and ſtable Covenant. But if we underſtand the word more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for <hi>faith</hi> (as it is uſed, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4.) then it teacheth, that the condition required on mans part in this Covenant, is true faith, whereby he renounceth himſelf, and layeth hold on the offer, and by reſting on the Word wherein the offer is made, cometh at length to real performance of what is promiſed in the Covenant, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.45. 9. That which is ſubjoyned, <hi>(and thou ſhalt know the Lord)</hi> may comprehend both Gods under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to work in them what the Covenant requires, (whether faith, as this word imports, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. or all other Covenant-diſpoſitions, or fruits of ſaving faith, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34.) and the effects of their embracing the Covenant, in experimental taſting what he is. And ſo it teacheth, 1. God is the undertaker for, and worker in his people of all that is required on their part for entring in and keeping Covenant with him; It is his promiſe, <hi>thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> 2. A right and ſanctified knowledge of God, is the root and companion of all ſanctified graces, and Covenant-diſpoſitions; Therefore all are comprehended in this, <hi>to know the Lord;</hi> Faith gets that name, not only becauſe of the certitude and evidence it brings with it, but becauſe it is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his Word and knowledge of him in it, and is cheriſhed and confirmed by taking him up ſtill more, as he is revealed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114928:31"/>
there, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. and other graces flow from this faith, and are cheriſhed by ſtudying to know him with whom we have to do. 3. When ſinners get grace to cloſe with God in the Covenant, then he will communicate himſelf, his hid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and rich love unto them; the nearer they come to him, they ſhall know the more of his excellency and fulneſſe, and they ſhall experimentally know what a partie he is with whom they are confederate, how like himſelf in his dealing, and how far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their ſhallow conceptions; For, then <hi>they ſhall know the Lord</hi> indeed; See <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8, 9. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.9.</p>

                     <p>The ſixth ground of conſolation, is a promiſe of plenty and outward meanes of ſubſiſtence, which is a fruit of Marriage, when he communicates (as it were) of his eſtate with her whom he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trotheth. The Lord promiſeth that all the creatures ſhould (ſo to ſay) concurre to ſeek to be employed to furniſh <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and God ſhould ſo bleſſe the order and influence of ſecond cauſes, as they ſhould evidently ſee God bleſſing them, who had been <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel,</hi> the ſcattered of the Lord, but will be then <hi>Jezreel,</hi> the ſeed of the Lord, as the next verſe intimateth. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. While the Lords people are within time, they may read their own frailty in needing ſo many things to uphold even their outward man; For, they need a bleſſing upon heaven and earth to furniſh food to them.

them not only ſubſiſt, but be as well as when they have moſt; and they may be as free of anxiety in greateſt wants, as if they had greateſt plenty: For, when they ſeek the beſt things, other things will certainly be added, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. when God hath given them his own Son, he will not deny leſſer things, when they are needed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32. and his providence in <hi>hearing</hi> the need of creatures, may eaſe them. 3. God is ſo tender a reſpector of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, that he hath an ear to hear the dumb cries of very inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible creatures in their need, and that they may be uſeful one to another, eſpecially for the good of his people; For, when the heaven is made iron, it hath a cry which he will hear for the good of inferiour creatures, and of his people: <hi>I will hear; ſaith the LORD, I will hear the Heavens.</hi> The repetition holdeth forth the certainty of it. 4. Gods reconciled people are to read, not only Gods love in their plenty, but that all the Creation (which groan under mans ſin,) do in their kinde, with a good-will, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre to ſerve him who is now at peace with their Maker: So much may be gathered alſo from their calling one to another in their order, and to God, that they may be bleſſed for the good of his people. 6. The Lord ſets a mark of excellency upon man, and eſpecially on his Church, in that ſo many things concurre to ſerve them, and provide for them; For, here <hi>heavens and earth,</hi> concurre for this end. 6. Whatever it be that one creature affords unto another, or may be in the courſe of nature expected from it; yet every creature in it ſelf is empty, and muſt be ſupplied by God before it ſatisfie any; For, let the Earth call to the Heavens for ordinary rain and influence, yet they cannot afford it till God hear them. 7. As the Lord is not to be tempted, but waited on in his eſtabliſhed order, for any thing, (as here, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be fed, by <hi>corne, and wine, and oyle,</hi> coming in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed courſe of nature;) So we are not to reſt on any ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or courſe of nature, but to ſee Gods hand in it, who eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and bleſſeth it for ſuch ends; For, <hi>the corne, and wine, and oyle, hear Jezreel,</hi> (not anſwering any prayers made to them, but ſupplying theſe neceſſities, which they are appointed for,) and the earth doth bring forth theſe, and the heavens give influence for that end, yet ſo as it is God who maketh all theſe ſo to do, and he is to be ſeen doing ſo. Not that he hears only the heavens, and then they hear all the reſt of ſecond cauſes, but that beginning at the heavens, he bleſſes their plenty in all the ſteps of ſecond cauſes, even to the putting a bleſſing in it, when it is produced; For it remaines ſtill in his hand to bleſſe or curſe it, even when
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114928:32"/>
it is in the basket and ſtore, and in mens mouthes. 8. The Lords former ſad diſpenſations toward his people, will not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to change his dealing, but he will be kinde and do them good ſo much the more; and thoughts of this will make his kindneſſe ſo much the ſweeter: For, albeit they had been <hi>Jez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reel</hi> in reſpect of their ſcattering, yet he would turn that into a name of bleſſing, and do them good ſo much the more.</p>

                     <p>In the ſeventh ground of conſolation, the Lord promiſeth that (according to the comfortable ſignification of their name <hi>Jezreel</hi>) he will make them to encreaſe as ſeed that is ſown doth multiply, that he will give them many proofes of his mercy after their hard uſage, and confirme them in their intereſt in him, after their rejection, which they ſhould embrace and acquieſce into: See <hi>chap.</hi> 1.10, 11. The Apoſtle doth apply this alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.25. to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſpirit both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> who were brought in to Chriſt, even in his time, becauſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the ſame with all the confederates, and there was then ſome accompliſhment in part of this prediction. But the full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof is reſerved for <hi>Iſrael</hi> (of whom this Chapter ſpeaks moſt expreſly) at their converſion as a Nation.

ſaith he. 3. None of the Lords people are ſo rejected, nor their condition ſo deſperate, but mercy and a Covenant can reach them, and recover them; For, <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> even <hi>upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will ſay to them which were not my people,</hi> (or to <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> Chap. 1.9.) <hi>Thou art my people.</hi> 4. Proofes of the Lords mercy in his diſpenſations, will not be ſufficient to aſſure and comfort his people, unleſſe they be aſſured of an intereſt in him, which is the chief of mercies; and which can only perſwade them, that there is mercy in his dealing: Therefore after this, <hi>I will have mercy,</hi> is ſubjoyned, <hi>Thou art my people,</hi> to make the comfort full and ſure. 5. As it is the duty of the Lords people to ſet their ſeal by faith to Gods offer, and acquieſce in him as an alſufficient portion: So theſe whom he chooſeth, he giveth them grace to chooſe him, and their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of, and cleaving to him, is an evidence of an intereſt in him; For, it is ſubjoyned as an evidence and effect of Gods owning of them, <hi>and they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God;</hi> And as it is God who muſt work this in his people, according as here he promiſeth it; ſo it is a ſweet and bleſſed condition, when there is ſuch a correſpondence betwixt him and them: He publickly owning and avowing them, and they avowing and rejoycing in him; He proclaiming, <hi>Thou art my people,</hi> and they reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou art my God.</hi>

                     <p>THis Chapter containes a new typical Sermon, of the ſame nature with the former, but differing ſomewhat in ſcope, as holding forth more diſtinctly the Lords method in performing theſe promiſes made to <hi>Iſrael, chap.</hi> 2. eſpecially that promiſe of betrothing her again, <hi>v.</hi> 19, 20. To wit, that though <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould not be finally caſt off, but be again betrothed unto Chriſt; yet they ſhould for a long time be kept in a low eſtate, to fit them for the marriage which ſhould certainly be in due time. This Prophecie cannot be underſtood of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Spirit, ſeeing <hi>Hoſea</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his charge, that had been married, and was now to be ſequeſtrate for a long time, which is only proper to the ten Tribes: Nor is it to be underſtood of <hi>Judah,</hi> nor of their returne from the captivity of <hi>Babylon;</hi> ſeeing <hi>Iſrael</hi> are named to whom <hi>Hoſea</hi> preached, and their ſeeking of Chriſt under the name of <hi>David,</hi> and that in the latter dayes, is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propheſied, <hi>v.</hi> 5. So it is to be looked on as a clear prediction of the preſent condition of the ten Tribes, and of their future conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of which, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
                     <p>The firſt particular in this Sermon, is firſt propounded in the type, and then explained: In ſumme, we may conceive it thus; The Prophet was to propound this type, that the caſe ſhould ſtand betwixt the Lord and the Nation, and Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their rejection, as if the Prophet were a lover, and that of his adulterous wife, whom he continued to love, though ſhe were juſtly repudiate for her adulterie, even ſo the matter ſtood here: The Lord had been her husband and loved her, ſhe had ingrately followed Idols and ſenſual pleaſures; for which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he was to repudiate her as not his wife, yet he would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his purpoſe of love toward her, in order to a ſecond betroth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Unto this doth the title of a <hi>friend</hi> here uſed, agree rather then that of an <hi>husband:</hi> For in this, the former marriage is diſſolved, and the new is not yet made up, only he hath a friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection to her, in order to it. And this title of a <hi>friend,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114928:33"/>
loving her as ſuch, with a purpoſe of marriage, ſeemeth to be an alluſion, (not ſo much to heathen cuſtomes, where there was ſome ſpecial lover under whoſe protection the harlot was, and who upon her good behaviour, would promiſe to marry her. As) to the cuſtome of an <hi>Iſraelites</hi> marrying the Heathen Virgin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.10,—13. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As it is matter of ſad challenge againſt the Church, that ſhe ingrately ſins againſt loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and is an adultereſſe unprovoked; (for ſo may be import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, that this <hi>adultereſſe</hi> had been <hi>beloved,</hi> and yet plaid the harlot; See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.3.) ſo loving kindneſſe doth not alwayes give up upon ſad provocations, nor upon ſaddeſt diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; for ſo is expreſſely held out here, the repudiate <hi>adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe</hi> is <hi>yet beloved of her friend,</hi> and this ſets out <hi>the love of the Lord toward the children of Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi> This holds true of the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to this day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29. and there may be toward all the Lords people, many ſweet purpoſes lying hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſad diſpenſations, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.11. 2. Such is mens ſtupidity in taking up their own caſe, and their ſuperficialneſſe in ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, that it needs to be much and ſenſibly inculcate; Therefore is this matter twice told, firſt in the type, <hi>Go yet,</hi> (after that former type, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.2.) <hi>love a woman, &amp;c.</hi> and then in the explication, <hi>according to the love of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> 3. This outward groſſe Idolatry with <hi>other gods,</hi> (as they judged them to be gods) which <hi>Iſrael</hi> was guilty of, and for which ſhe was repudiate, may teach; That corrupting the Worſhip of God, and declining from him and his way, is the great ſin for which the Lord doth plead, and may at laſt reject a viſible Church: and albeit tentations to ſuch courſes may be removed from a Church; yet the diſpenſation and way of <hi>Iſrael</hi> may warne us, that the hearts of all men are prone that way, if they had a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we encline more to falſe worſhip then true, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we have falſe wayes to heaven and happineſſe; and that idols, and not the true God, are chief in our hearts. And when God and his way of ſervice are not delighted in, we may charge all theſe upon our ſelves; So much may we gather from this challenge againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they <hi>look to other gods,</hi> or, turning their back on God, they placed their affection, confidence, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, reſpex on Idols; For, <hi>looking</hi> doth import this, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 123.1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.16, 24. 4. The challenge joyned with this, that they <hi>love flagons of wine,</hi> or ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, doth teach, that as idolatry and falſe worſhip are plagued with ſenſuality and delight in it, (as witneſſe the feaſts of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114928:34"/>
                        <hi>Exod</hi> 32.6.) So ſenſual men bewray their own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that they are ripe for being Idolaters, if they had the tryal: Therefore are they conjoyned in the challenge, as having much affinity, and drawing on one another.</p>

                     <p>In theſe verſes, the type of the ſecond and third parts of the Chapter is propounded; As if the Prophet ſhould purchaſe this adultereſſe out of the hand of all her lovers, for ſo much money and barley, and ſequeſtrate her from himſelf and them, to live on this ſober entertainment, in hope of marriage, if ſhe carried her ſelf well; So ſhould it be betwixt the Lord and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as is explained in the following verſes. Albeit this type be expounded by the Lord himſelf; yet ſince his ſpeaking of the matter twice, invites us to look on it again and again; <hi>I</hi> ſhall obſerve ſomewhat on the type, And firſt, the Prophets purchaſing the adultereſſe for ſo much money, is not to be ſtrained to ſignifie the Lords re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming of his Church, for the price is given to her ſelf for maintenance, and to purchaſe her good-will, though ſhe be his own, in order to ſecond marriage; But it teacheth, that as a common ſtrumpet being bought from all her lovers, and a ſlave bought with money, are at the buyers diſpoſal; So, however <hi>Iſrael</hi> followed many idols, yet the Lord would prove that he alone had dominion over her, to ſet her in what condition he pleaſed, where none of her lovers ſhould help her. Secondly, the price given for her, <hi>fifteen pieces of ſilver,</hi> (whereby we are to underſtand ſo many ſhekels,) being but half a ſervants worth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.32. and half the eſtimation of a woman, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.4. may teach, how little worth they are, and how baſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible they make themſelves, who deſpiſe the Lord, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his Worſhip; as may be ſeen on the <hi>Jewes</hi> to this day, and much more on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who are in a manner loſt in the World;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114928:34"/>
See <hi>Amos</hi> 9.7. Thirdly, this ſmall price with the barley joyned with it, and given her, being but little and ſober fare, and unfit food, eſpecially for women, may teach, 1. That ſenſuality provokes God to ſend pinching penury; For, ſhe who <hi>loved flagons of wine, v.</hi> 1. cometh to this fare. 2. That we muſt be much ſtripped of all things, before we be ſenſible and weaned from our idols: For, this adultereſſe muſt be thus pinched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe give over her wantonneſſe: Our hearts are ſo mad on Idols, that they will be fed ſo long as we have any thing to our ſelves. Fourthly, his charging her to abide many dayes ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, not playing the harlot, nor enjoying him, (for ſo the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal hath it, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be for a man,</hi> either me or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,) but having hope of marriage if ſhe did well, may teach. 1. That cutting ſhort of outward mercies, ſhould cut off ſin, and humble us that we may be ripe for mercy; and whatever our frame and carriage be, yet by affliction God will cut ſhort occaſions of ſin; For, as an adultereſſe ſhut up and dieted, is ſecluded from her lovers; ſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Gods diſpenſations, is made <hi>to abide, and not be for a man.</hi> 2. The Lord may intend much good to them whom he brings in contempt, and to a low condition: For, he ſequeſtrates and ſhuts up <hi>Iſrael</hi> thus, with an eye to marrying of her. 3. Such as God intends this mercy for, may yet continue long in a ſad condition; partly, to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his diſpleaſure againſt his people, when he is provoked to reject them; and partly, that they may ſee the ill of their wayes, and may cleave to God the faſter, when he reſtores them; For, <hi>Iſrael is to abide many dayes,</hi> whereof we have ſeen a ſad accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment from the time of their captivity to this day; whereof though they get no uſe in the time of their rejection, yet it will be otherwiſe when they turne to God. 4. As it is a choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in affliction, not to forſake God, nor cleave to other idols, though he ſeem to reject us; So it is a token for good to Gods people, when by affliction he cuts ſhort their ſin; For, ſo this ſequeſtrating her, is expounded to be, an abiding for him, <hi>abide for me.</hi> Although ſhe be rejected from being the Lords wife, and have little minde or expectation of him; yet the Lords ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating her from idolatry, (to wit, in a national way) in her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, is a proof, that he will make it an abiding for him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe intend, or expect in it. Fifthly, this typical promiſe of his abiding for her, as ſhe doth for him, <hi>(ſo will I alſo be for thee,)</hi> is not to be ſtrictly preſſed, ſeeing God hath ſince the time of their rejection, choſen the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> though it may be thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114928:35"/>
1. He chooſed none till the Meſſiah, under whom they are to be converted, came in the fleſh. 2. All whom he chooſeth muſt put this reſpect upon the elder brother, (though now gone out of the houſe) that they become <hi>Iſrael,</hi> before they lay claim to <hi>Iſraels</hi> Covenant. 3. Whomever the Lord hath choſen, yet he hath a room in his heart for them, and will have them mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him, and this exhauſts the ſcope. 4. Their converſion will be indeed as his ſolemne marriage-day, and a reſurrection from the dead to the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. and that day will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence what reſpect he had to them in their loſt condition. And ſo it may teach us, 1. Notwithſtanding the glorious dayes of the Son of man, that appear in the world by the converſion of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and their marriage to him; yet his ancient people are not forgotten by him: But as of old when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were his Church, yet he minded the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and purpoſed their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, <hi>John</hi> 10.16. ſo his heart is on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till they be brought in. 2. Not only is it a token that God hath reſerved comfort for them, who will not have any comfort in trouble without him, but as a ſhut-up adultereſſe, do renounce all lovers till their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band embrace them again: But when the Lord makes his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affliction continue ſad, without any outgate beſide himſelf, it is a pledge that he hath thoughts of peace toward them in that trouble; For, <hi>he abideth for her,</hi> who is made to <hi>abide,</hi> and <hi>not to be for a man,</hi> or ſecluded from any comfortable condition, as a ſhut-up harlot. This is the condition of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at this day, who are kept in ſo low a condition beyond all Nations, that they may never flouriſh till God turne them to him, and he embrace them. Sixthly, the Prophets doing all this in obedience to that command, <hi>v.</hi> 1. to <hi>love the woman,</hi> may teach, 1. That as tender husbands do ſhut up, and pinch their wanton and treacherous wives, for their good; So the Lords love may oft-times be viſible in hard uſage, and denying indulgence to his incorrigible people; and his love be ordered by prudent and wholeſome ſeverity to tame them. 2. That not to be cut off, but made to ſubſiſt in the ſaddeſt condition, in hope of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mercy, is a rich expreſſion of love; For, ſo doth his love toward <hi>Iſrael</hi> appear, in that he preſerveth them, however ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or loſt in mens eyes, with a purpoſe to do them good in the latter end. See <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22, 26, 29.</p>

                     <p>Here we have the ſecond thing in the Chap. and an Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the firſt part of the type, concerning the adultereſſe her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſequeſtrate in a baſe and poor condition; This the Lord expounds to ſignifie, that albeit he was to caſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> out, yet for the Elects ſake in her, and becauſe of the Covenant made with her Fathers, he would teſtifie his love to her, by making her to ſubſiſt during the long time of her captivity; though in a ſober and mean condition, wanting a civil State, and without the uſe either of a true Religion, (ſignified by <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> and <hi>an Ephod,</hi>) or a falſe; ſignified by <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Teraphim,</hi> which were a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar ſort of Images, repreſenting (as is conceived) their Idols in humane ſhape. This prediction cannot be underſtood of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> nor of all of them taking them diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, for certainly at all times where ever they are, they have ſome Religion, either true or falſe; But it is to be taken of <hi>Iſrael</hi> collectively, that as a Nation they could neither ſet up, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme true or falſe worſhip, as they had done before their rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and ſo it is oppoſed to their national converſion. Further, when the Lord foretels that they ſhall be deprived of true Worſhip under the name of a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and <hi>Ephod,</hi> (comprehending under this, all their Prieſtly garments, and their Prieſts who uſed them in publick worſhip,) it is not his purpoſe to juſtifie their borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe from <hi>Judah,</hi> and making uſe of them in the worſhip of the calves, as true and acceptable worſhip; but being ſuch as they ſuppoſed true, and came neareſt to it, yet they ſhould be deprived of it. Or, the words are to be taken abſolutely, without reſtriction to what they had before, to ſignifie that they ſhould have no true worſhip at all. From this we may (beſide what is held out in the type.) further <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. As the Lord may make the fruits of ſin very bitter and ſad, and of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even to his own people; So, ſuch a condition may have mercy in it, and may yet end in mercy; For, albeit what is here held out, be very ſad, and of continuance for <hi>many dayes,</hi> yet they <hi>abide</hi> under it, and are made to ſubſiſt till better come. 2. The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114928:36"/>
want of a face of Government of a Nations ſelf, is a miſery to be laid to heart, either when a people are ſcattered from being a Nation, or are ruled over by ſtrangers; and yet it is a miſery under which a people may be preſerved for much mercy; For, it is foretold here as a part of <hi>Iſraels</hi> miſery, that they ſhall be <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a King, and without a Prince,</hi> without any face of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſſe or more, over them of their own Nation, being ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among the Nations, and under the Government of others where they come: and yet in this caſe, they <hi>abide</hi> till the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage come. 3. As the publick Worſhip of God is a ſweet cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial in affliction, and the want thereof a judgement, which the Lord will bring on his deareſt people, when they provoke him: and as it is a ſad judgement to want the face of a viſible Church, even albeit there were ſome corruption in it; So, corrupting the Worſhip of God, provokes him to give up a people to have no worſhip at all: For, this prediction, they ſhall abide <hi>without a ſacrifice, and without an Image, and without an Ephod, and without Teraphim,</hi> doth not import that ſimply it is a judgement to want corrupt worſhip, (though whoriſh <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s time might think ſo, as an harlot would do to be ſhut up from her Paramours, which is indeed a woful temper,) nor doth it here import ſo much a mercy to deprive her of corrupt worſhip in her trouble, (though it be ſo in it ſelf, and he intend mercy in all of this;) But the ſcope is, to ſhew, that whereas the people of God may gather comfort, either from the enjoying of the pure Worſhip of God in ſad times, or from the continuance of ſome face of a Church, though corrupt, as a token that God hath not yet totally rejected; yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> (though God have a purpoſe of good to her, and do preſerve her for it,) ſhould enjoy none of theſe. She ſhall neither have the true Religion, nor the face of a Church and Worſhip as they had it, to aſſure them that they were not quite divorced; and this is the fruit of their corrupting the Worſhip of God, and ſerving of Idols. 4. It is a judgement and token of Gods ſeverity, (whatever love be intended in it) when a Nation are given up not to be wholly the Lords, nor do ſerve him in a national way, nor are a national Church to him: For, ſuch is the miſery of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to this day, that they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Worſhip and any Church-State as a Nation; and if their converſion and Worſhip, and Church State under the Goſpel, ſhall be national, (as the oppoſition muſt carry it,) then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a national Church is no Paradoxe under the Goſpel.</p>

Albeit <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath been, and yet is rejected and loſt; yet they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly returne to God; For, ſo is here propheſied expreſſely, <hi>afterward ſhall the children of Iſrael return,</hi> and this we are much to long and pray for. 2. As true repentance and converſion will appear in mens being ſenſible of their great diſtance from God, and in their ſeeking to make up this diſtance, (albeit they cannot as yet prove much enjoyment,) and ſeeking him chiefly and only, in place of many things which natural hearts luſt after; ſo, all this is a ſweet and bleſſed fruit of affliction: For, ſuch ſhall be the reſult of <hi>Iſraels</hi> being in a low condition, <hi>they ſhall returne and ſeek the Lord.</hi> 3. The Covenant ſtandeth ſtill to be forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Apoſtates, when they repent and turne to God, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing falſe wayes and worſhip; For, ſo will <hi>Iſrael</hi> finde; when they return, they are allowed to ſeek <hi>the Lord their God:</hi> and any who <hi>ſeek the Lord,</hi> ought not to make themſelves an ill anſwer, but come, and they will finde him their God. 4. There is no right ſeeking of God, nor finding of him, or the comforts of the Covenant, but through Chriſt, whom converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall acknowledge and embrace; For, <hi>they ſhall ſeek the Lord their God, and David their King.</hi> 5. Chriſt is here named <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>their,</hi> (or <hi>Iſraels) King;</hi> ſo alſo, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.23, 24. and 37.24. not only becauſe he is <hi>Davids</hi> Son and Heire, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.16. and becauſe <hi>David</hi> was a type of him: But 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in their converſion, they will have a deep ſenſe of their ſinful revolt from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> which began their woe and Apoſtaſy; true penitents will trace back their defection to the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114928:37"/>
very fountain and beginning of it, with much ſorrow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. 2. Becauſe Chriſt the ſubſtance will be eminently ſuch a King unto them, (as he is to all his people,) as <hi>David</hi> the type was unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old. 3. Becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt, as to acknowledge him in all his offices; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, ſhall ſubmit to him as a King, which is the duty of all true Converts. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. True converſion will appear in its conſtancy and perſeverance; and particularly, in the Converts entertaining an holy fear and aw of God: For, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall <hi>returne and ſeek the Lord,</hi> they ſhall alſo hold on, <hi>and ſhall fear the Lord.</hi> 7. As God is alwayes good to his own people, whatever they think to the contrary, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1, 2. ſo much of his goodneſſe will be manifeſted in the time of that life from the dead, when all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved: For, ſo is imported here, the Lords <hi>goodneſſe</hi> will then be matter of holy exerciſe. 8. The goodneſſe of God will not make a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert preſumptuous; but will be unto him matter of reverence, and holy fear and trembling: For, <hi>they ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſſe.</hi> 9. Albeit <hi>Iſrael</hi> be long in gathering and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting; yet we are firmely to beleeve, that before time end, it will certainly come to paſſe: For, all this ſhall be in <hi>the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dayes:</hi> Which albeit it often ſignifie all the time of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel; yet in this prediction is to be taken for that period of time more immediately preceding the end of the World.</p>

                     <p>HItherto this Prophet, in the Lords Name, hath denounced the finall deſtruction, and propheſied of the future conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> making uſe of ſome types for that end. Now in a great part of this enſuing Prophecy, he proceeds in more plain termes, to rip up, and lay open the iniquitie of this people, and to reveal and denounce future judgements, if ſo be there might be any hope of reclaiming them, or any of them; at leaſt, that they might be left without all excuſe. In this Chap. we have Gods controverſie pleaded againſt them, wherein is contained an accuſation for diverſe ſins, drawn up in ſeveral articles, to every one of which the ſentence, or threatening, is ſubjoyned.</p>
                     <p>In theſe Verſes, Firſt, they are cited to the Tribunal, to hear the controverſie diſcuſſed. Then, the firſt article of the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſubjoyned, which is more generall, laying to their charge the violation of the Law in many omiſſions and commiſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both Tables; Namely, that there was no truth nor ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe in their dealing, no ſpark of the knowledge of God ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their way; but on the contrary, perjury, and raſh ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, murther, ſtealing, and adultery were committed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out moderation, and ſin heaped upon ſin. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the ſervants of the Lord may oft-times have little or no ground of hope, that their Miniſtery ſhall have any ſucceſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, yet it is their duty, having Gods call, not to give over while they have any opportunity; For, albeit in the former Sermons the matter be ſo cloſed, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was certainly to go into captivity, yet <hi>Hoſea</hi> doth not give over pleading, as God doth put them to it, when they are laid by, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. So their Miniſtery will have its own ſucceſſe one way or other, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:114928:38"/>
55.10, 11. and their labours will not be loſt before the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.4, 5. 2. As they who are neareſt to God for outward relations, may have their own groſſe faults, which their titles and priviledges will not cover; So the Lord will eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them, becauſe of theſe: For, ſo is verified here in the <hi>children of Iſrael,</hi> againſt whom this procedure is. 3. When men look on ſad and unpleaſant meſſages, as coming from God, it will call on them, to receive them with other reſpect then is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when men are only ſeen; for this end doth he begin with, <hi>Hear the word of the Lord.</hi> 4. When people (and eſpecially the Church) do ſin, they muſt expect a proceſſe to follow it; and when people do not make right uſe of better tydings from the Word, they muſt expect ſad challenges and ſentences from it; And when the authority of God contending by his Word, is not heeded, the Lord is provoked to plead the controverſie more immediately: For, <hi>the Lord hath a controverſie</hi> following on ſin, and this is pleaded partly by the Word here, and (that not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding) by the judgements here threatned. 5. Sin is ſo much the more odious, and doth provoke God, when it is univerſal, and committed by theſe who have found him true in his promiſe, and rich in his bounty to them: For, it is a <hi>controverſie with the inhabitants of the land,</hi> or with the body of the people now corrupted, and with the people who were ſetled in that good land which he had ſworn to their Fathers, to give it them. 6. It doth commend the Lords mercy, and clear his juſtice, when it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted on his ſinfull people, that he doth not ſtrike before he hath warned them of their danger, and debated the matter with them: For, here he warnes them by the Prophet, and before he execute the ſentence, he doth plead the cauſe, that they may conſider of it. 7. As the viſible Church not walking with God, may become monſtrous in ſinfulneſſe; ſo the Lord doth not contend with her without cauſe, or for leſſer faults and ordinary infirmities, (though theſe do juſtly provoke him to anger,) but for groſſe debordings in omiſſion or commiſſion: So much doth this accuſation teach in the general. 8. The Lord will not be mocked or deceived with any pretences of Religion, when men neglect the duties of the ſecond Table; Therefore doth he begin the challenge with theſe, and inſiſt moſt on them. 9. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſecret mourners there may be in a corrupt Chuch, yet when the contagion becometh general, and riſeth to an height, the Lord will take no notice of them; as to holding off a common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity: For, albeit there were (no doubt) ſome good men in the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114928:39"/>
land, yet he ſaith, <hi>there is no truth, &amp;c. in the land,</hi> becauſe they might get their ſoules for a prey, but would not turne his anger from the land. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5. &amp; 14.14, 16, 18. 10. The Lord abhorreth flattery in his people, their want of ingenuity, their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick and ſubtile carriages, and unfaithfulneſs and deceit in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and truſts; That may be the cauſe of Gods ſore controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which men look on as an handſome conveyance: For, <hi>the Lord hath a controverſie, becauſe there is no truth,</hi> 11. Such as caſt off bowels of mercy, and exerciſe oppreſſion, (either where the cauſe is unjuſt, or a juſt cauſe cruelly proſecuted, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on added to the afflicted,) may expect judgement without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, if they perſevere in it; For, <hi>the Lord hath a controverſie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no mercy.</hi> 12. As the true knowledge of God, is the fountaine and root of true Religion; and as mens ill carriage in duties one to another, doth prove them void of the knowledge of God and of Religion, profeſſe what they will: So ignorance of God continued in and affected, and appearing in ſuch effects, is the matter of a ſad controverſie againſt the Church; For, he challengeth, that there <hi>is no knowledge of God in the land,</hi> that is, they are void of any Religion, which flowes from ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and accompanieth it, and in their way toward others, they walked as if there were no God in heaven; and this is a ſad challenge when it is <hi>in the land,</hi> where he may, and eſpecially ſhould be known, and acknowledged; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.1. See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 14.1. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. 13. Not only perjurie and falſe ſwearing, but vain and raſh ſwearing, (wherein men bewray their high preſumption in prophaning the Name of God, and violating his command, without any the leaſt appearance of profit or advantage,) will be pleaded againſt, when the Lord proſecutes a controverſie againſt a land, Therefore is <hi>ſwearing</hi> put in the catalogue of the cauſes of this controverſie. 14. As lying is a ſin inconſiſtent with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſociety, and doth provoke the Lord to juſt wrath: So ſuch as are raſh ſwearers, will readily make no conſcience of lies; Therefore is <hi>lying</hi> ſubjoyned to <hi>ſwearing,</hi> as frequently conjoyned with it, and as another cauſe of the controverſie. 15. God hath fenced the lives, eſtates, and chaſtity of men by his Law, which when it is tranſgreſſed, God will reckon with men for blood, cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, idleneſſe, oppreſſion, filthineſſe, and other wayes whereby they violate theſe and for the leaſt as well as the greateſt of them, as drawing on wrath; For, he contends, becauſe of <hi>killing, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and committing adultery,</hi> all of them as cauſes of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, though not all alike hainous. 16. It is a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:114928:39"/>
of ſin, when men in committing of it, do break over all banks of Law, moderation, or civility, and do ſin without remorſe, ſhame or fear; For, he challengeth that in all theſe, <hi>they break,</hi> or <hi>burſt out,</hi> as a torrent of waters do burſt through the banks which are ſet to keep them in. 17. Ordinarily one ſin given way unto, or entertained, doth draw on another, till there be no end, and till the meaſure be filled up; For, <hi>blood toucheth blood,</hi> or their bloody crimes are heaped one upon and after another; or their murthers were ſo many, that dead carcaſes lay by heaps one upon another.</p>

Sinful man is a great enemy to all the creatures, as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he makes both himſelf and them to mourne and pine away, becauſe he will not mourne indeed; For, <hi>The land mourneth, the dwellers languiſh with the beaſts of the field, &amp;c.</hi> who are <hi>taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17, 18 4. As the glory of all the creatures is but a flower, which God will ſoon make to wither and <hi>languiſh</hi> when he purſueth for ſin; So the creatures will not help man when God is angry at him, but as theſe draw him from God, ſo God is provoked to cut him ſhort in them, as here they are conſumed with him.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond Article of the accuſation, containeth a challenge for their deſperate and incorrigible impenitency; that albeit they were guilty of theſe groſſe ſins mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. and of many others, yet it was to no purpoſe to reprove or ſeek to reclaime them: For, they would admit of no admonition, private or publick, and if any did eſſay to do it, they would reject and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, though it were even their teachers urging the ſentence of the Law. He ſaith, <hi>as they that ſtrive,</hi> which <hi>as</hi> in Scripture-language is not only a note of ſimilitude, but a declaration that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they did ſo. See <hi>Job.</hi> 1.14. <hi>We ſaw his glory, as the glory, &amp;c.</hi> that is, not like unto it, but certainly the ſame which became the Son of God. Or it may be conceived, that many of their Prieſts did not rebuke them, but the people were ſo obſtinate as to ſtrive with them, if they did: Or, he ſpeaks ſo of their ſtriving with their Prieſts ſet up by <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> becauſe they were not true Prieſts; but though they had been ſo, yet the people would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and they held them to be ſuch, and yet contended with them. In ſumme, the challenge is that their caſe was ſo deſperate, as uſe of needful means would rather irritate then amend them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit decliners may ſeem to be little engaged at firſt, yet when ſin is given way unto, it is not eaſily removed, nor without much ſtrife: For, ſo is imported here, that any who hoped to reclaime them, behoved to <hi>ſtrive.</hi> 2. Every man in his ſtation is bound to oppoſe the growth and continuance of ſin, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he ſhould meet with much oppoſition and ſtrife; and to keep peace with God in doing duty, albeit he ſhould incurre the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all the world; For, it is imported, that it is the duty of every man <hi>to ſtrive, and reprove another.</hi> See <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. 3. It is an hainous aggravation of ſin, when men become incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and much more when they riſe againſt theſe who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, and become their enemie who tell the truth: For, this is the expreſſe challenge, <hi>Let no man ſtrive, &amp;c.</hi> that is, it is to no purpoſe to deal with them, for they not only amend not, but grow worſe, and ſtrive again, as is uſual, that where means are not bleſſed, men become worſe. 4. As it renders men baſe, and <hi>thy people,</hi> when they turne incorrigible, and haters and perſecuters of the light, and ſuch as bring it to them; ſo
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114928:40"/>
then they are to be left to God to take courſe with them; For, it is then, <hi>The Lord hath a controverſie, v.</hi> 1. and then, <hi>let no man ſtrive, &amp;c.</hi> that is, albeit the Prophet here give out Gods doom, yet in ordinary they were dogs and ſwine, before whom pearles were not to be caſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. 5. Albeit Miniſters be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and when they erre, may be oppoſed by any; yet it is an hainous impiety when they become the eye-ſore of a time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their oppoſition unto iniquity and defection; For, it is in this reſpect they are challenged to be as <hi>they that ſtrive with the Prieſt;</hi> See 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.8.</p>

                     <p>The third Article of this accuſation, is againſt the corrupt Prieſts and teachers, and is intended not ſo much againſt theſe Prieſts of <hi>Aarons</hi> family, and other Levites, who after the rent and defection of the ten Tribes, ſtaid ſtill in <hi>Iſrael</hi> becauſe of their inheritance; as againſt <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Prieſts, who whatever they were before God, yet ſince they took the name and office on them, the Lord threatens them for not walking anſwerably. This Article hath ſeveral branches, in the firſt whereof, he reprehends them for the ignorance of the people, occaſioned through their negligence, and their rejecting and ſleighting of the means of knowledge which might enable them to teach others For which he threatens to caſt them out of the office they ſeemed to have, and to reject their poſterity that they ſhould not exceed them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As ignorance is a very riſe and deſtroying ſin in the viſible Church; ſo the guilt thereof doth oft-times lie in great part at Preachers doors, with whom God will reckon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114928:41"/>
to the priviledges of his people, whatever they be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; For, ſaith he, <hi>My people periſh for lack of knowledge,</hi> and this the Lord challengeth the Prieſts for, and as being the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it in thoſe who were his people, though they deſerved not the name, as, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 2. Such as would be able to teach others, ought to take much pains that they may be inſtructed themſelves from God in his Word: Ignorant Miniſters are great plagues, their private idleneſſe is the cauſe why they do not edifie in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; and when the Lord doth not teach them, they will not reach others to purpoſe; Therefore it is a challenge againſt them, and a cauſe of the former ill, <hi>thou haſt rejected knowledge,</hi> to wit, of <hi>the Law,</hi> as is after cleared. 3. The more familiar occaſion of converſe men have with holy things, wanting holineſſe, their contempt and diſlike of them will be the greater, and their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to light have the more of perverſity, and leſſe of infirmity in it; For, theſe Prieſts do <hi>reject knowledge,</hi> or wickedly, and with contempt, deſpiſe it. 4. Such as do for a time reject and reſiſt means of knowledge, when it bears it ſelf upon them, may at laſt come to forget it without a challenge, to loſe the light they had, and to be nothing moved with any ſtamp of authority that is in what God ſaith; Therefore it is added to the former, <hi>thou haſt forgotten the Law,</hi> that is, not only loſt any ſmall knowledge of it they had, but they had as little minde of it, and it as lit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>le authority in their hearts, or bred them as little diſquiet, when they neglected it, or went otherwiſe wrong, as if they had never heard of it. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50 17. 5. The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation any pretend to God, by vertue of their general or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar calling, the Lord will make uſe thereof to aggreage their ſin and unanſwerable walking; Therefore doth the Lord name him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>thy God,</hi> becauſe they pretended ſo, and to ſhew that if they got not benefit by ſuch a relation, it ſhould adde to their wo. And ſo the blinde preſumption of many will but make their ditty the greater, while they pretend to much intereſt in God, and yet their way looks nothing like ſuch a pretence. 6. Unfaithfulneſſe in offices, (eſpecially in the Church) will caſt men out of it as unſavoury ſalt, with much guilt; which is a ſad judgement, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to ſuch a Maſter being honourable, and eſpecially to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to him in holy things; For, it is his ſentence, <hi>I will alſo reject thee, that thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to me,</hi> to wit, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they were. However men may ſpare ſuch who by neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing duty, prove that they keep the office injuſtly, yet God will not. 7. However the poſterity of godly Miniſters may oft-times
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114928:42"/>
meet with hard meaſure from an ingrate world, as well as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters themſelves; yet it is the righteous judgement of God on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Miniſters, that as they neglect and forget Gods children committed to their charge, ſo God ſuffers their poſterity to be neglected; For, <hi>I will alſo forget thy children,</hi> who it ſeemeth ſucceeded to them, in imitation of the order eſtabliſhed by God in <hi>Aarons</hi> Family.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114928:42"/>
the ſacrifices which fell to them. And therefore they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous and glad to have the people fall in many ſins, that ſo they might get many ſacrifices whereof to ſhare. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit livelihood be due to faithful Miniſters, and they who ſerve at the Altar, ſhould live of the Altar; yet it is the fearful ſinne of Miniſters, when they minde only the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or profit of their calling, neglecting the duty; when they are ſo addicted to their belly, as they can flatter, or be ſilent from reproving ſin, ſo they may gaine and have to eat; For, this a challenge, <hi>They eat up the ſin,</hi> (or, <hi>ſacrifices for ſin) of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> (called ſo, as, <hi>v.</hi> 6.) and this is all they minde in that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice.

the Prieſts carriage formerly mentioned. And this is an addition to the Prieſts judgment, that they draw ſo many with them into it. 2.

When men have made no conſcience of ſin, ſo they might compaſſe theſe delights, which they think will make them up; yet it is eaſie for God to prove that the bleſſing of theſe delights are only in his hand, and that men gain nothing by enjoying them, but a ſad diſappointment of their expectation from them, and an ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beſide; For, (ſaith he, explaining that generall of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding, <hi>v.</hi> 9.) <hi>they ſhall eat,</hi> of theſe ſacrifices which they ſo ſinfully longed after, <hi>and</hi> yet <hi>not having enough.</hi> 6.

In times of defection, it is good to be well acquainted with, and ſcene in the cauſes of it, and what diſtempers draw men to that height they go; Therefore doth the Prophet here point at it. 2.

                     <p>The fourth article of this accuſation is general againſt the whole people for their groſſe and heatheniſh idolatry (which is as adultery, a forſaking of God, and their duty of ſubjection to which they ſtand bound by the marriage-Covenant;) This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in their conſulting with their ſtocks of Images, and their ſtaves, or arrowes, (which flowed from their ſtrong inclinations to Idolatry, cheriſhed by Satan) and in their ſacrificing openly to Idols on mountains, under the ſhade of groves, eſteeming that heatheniſh way beſt: for this the Lord threatens to give up their daughters, and daughters in law, (and others, whom they would have chaſte) to bodily filthineſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When ever the viſible Church forſakes God, he will not forget his kindneſs to her, to aggreage her ſinne, and to prove that ſhe hath done it without provocation; Therefore againe the title is <hi>my people,</hi> to ſhew that he had intreated them as ſuch; and that he having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen them from among all people for himſelf, and as his portion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8, 9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.21. it was a greater ſinne in them then in any, ſo to behave themſelves. 2. Albeit Idolaters will not take with it that they worſhip ſtocks and ſticks, yet in reality they do ſo; and hereby they prove their own madneſſe in ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114928:44"/>
themſelves to theſe creatures that are inferior to them; and the baſeneſſe of their Religion, in that they have ſo poore wayes to know the mindes of their Idols; for, <hi>they aske counſell at their ſtocks,</hi> (and ſo conſult with them as their gods, and performe religious worſhip to them; that they may know their minde) <hi>and their ſtaffe declareth unto them,</hi> that is, any illuſion they get, they take it for a divine reſponſe. For the way of divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a ſtaffe, or arrowes, See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21.21, 22. It ſeemes, that when he doubted which City to aſſault firſt, ſeverall ſtaves or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towes having the names of the ſeverall places on them, being ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken together in a quiver that which was firſt drawn out deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the queſtion. And ſo Idolaters reſolved other caſes. 3. The backſliding and Idolatry of the viſible Church is not to be looked on lightly, or as an infirmity, but as flowing from the power of Satan, working upon that ſtrong inclination that is naturally in all men (and ſpecially in theſe who have not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the love of the truth) to follow error; Therefore is it given as a reaſon, <hi>For the ſpirit of whoredomes hath cauſed them to erre,</hi> which is to be underſtood both of their own inclinations, and of the working of the evill ſpirit, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.9. which makes them ſo bent and zealous in it, and warnes us not to be taken up with every zeale, nor with every religion wherein men ſeeme to be zealous. 4. They who commit Idolatry, and follow falſe Religions, and ſo do renounce ſubjection to God, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from under his directions, they do alſo put themſelves from under his protection; for, in both theſe reſpects it is true, <hi>they have gone a whoring from under their God,</hi> renouncing that ſubjection due to him, by violating the Marriage-Covenant, and ſo depriving themſelves of that protection which was enſured to them by the Covenant. 5. Sin is then come to a great height and very ripe for judgement, when men caſt off all veiles of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences or ſhame, and do openly and avowedly commit it; for, he challengeth when <hi>they ſacrifice upon the tops of the mountaines, &amp;c.</hi> avowedly, without ſhame, and not in corners onely. 6. It is high preſumption in fraile men to think to invent finer or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of worſhip by their wit, then what God hath appointed, or that they can put holineſſe on things or places; for, it was their ſin to chooſe <hi>mountaines</hi> and <hi>hils</hi> and ſhadowes of trees and groves, in imitation of he Patriarchs (whom the heathen did alſo imitate) as if theſe places were more ſacred; and to do this as <hi>good,</hi> and better and more apt to ſtrike men with reverence then what God had appointed, 7. It is no ſtrange thing, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114928:45"/>
men in chooſing their Religion, be led by their own fleſhly luſts, and that they account that beſt, which pleaſeth theſe moſt; for, in this reſpect alſo they accounted the <hi>ſhadow good,</hi> that is, more delectable to their fleſh. 8. Sin may be very ſadly puniſhed when no ſtroakes are inflicted, but the ſinner given up to more ſin, and particularly, ſpirituall adultery may be puniſhed with bodily filthineſſe; for, <hi>Therefore your daughters ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whoredome, and your ſpouſes ſhall commit adultery,</hi> to which they were tempted by wandering from their families into theſe ſolitary and retired places. And this ſhould warne all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors to beware of ſtraining the true Religion by ſuch blemiſhes as are a plague upon Idolaters. See, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.21, 25, 26, 27. 9. God may juſtly puniſh the ſins of parents in their children, and may make us ſenſible of our unfaithfulneſſe to God, in the ill carriage of others who are bound to us; for, he puniſheth their ſin in their daughters, and lets them ſee their whoredome againſt God, in the lewdneſſe of their daughters and ſpouſes, injuring and bringing reproach on them and their family.</p>

For which as he did puniſh them in giving up their daughters and ſpouſes to uncleanneſſe, ſo his forbearance of that fault for a time, was onely becauſe he had a greater quarrel againſt them for their Idolatry, which drew on the other; and for which, and their affected ignorance in it, he would at laſt when it came to an height, certainly deſtroy the Nation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is one of the ſore judgements of God, and tokens of his anger,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:114928:45"/>
when he takas no wains by needfull corrections, to reſtrain the courſe of a peoples ſin, but looſeth the rains, and lets them run on for a time; for, it is a threatening, <hi>I will not puniſh your daughters when they commit whoredome, nor your ſpouſes when they commit adultery.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>Heb</hi> 12. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. 2. When the Lord lets particular ſinners go on unpuniſhed, it is not becauſe they ſhall ſtill be ſpared, (for the text ſaith, they ſhall certainly <hi>fall;</hi>) But firſt, becauſe ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming generall, is paſſed over in particular perſons, till it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen for a national ſtroak: Secondly, his ſparing of them and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for ſome ſins, is becauſe he hath a greater quarrel and cauſe of controverſie, for all which together, he will in due time reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Both theſe are imported in that reaſon ſubjoyned to the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of not puniſhing their daughters, <hi>for themſelves,</hi> (that is, not only their daughters and ſpouſes, but the parents and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands: He ſpeaks of them, and not to them, as formerly, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie his indignation againſt them,) <hi>are ſeparated with whores, and they ſacrifice with harlots;</hi> where by <hi>whores</hi> and <hi>harlots,</hi> we are to underſtand not only ſpiritually, their Idols and Paramours with whom they committed ſpiritual adultery, but even literally their harlots whom they feaſted and courted in the time of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the groves, committing both ſpiritual and bodily adultery together. And ſo the force of the reaſon is, That ſin of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is more general, and more are guilty of it then their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſpouſes, and therefore they are ſpared till <hi>the people</hi> or Nation <hi>fall</hi> together; and that it is no wonder he ſpare them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he hath a greater quarrel becauſe of their Idolatry; for which, when by reaſon of his indulgence, they have added bodily filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to it, he will certainly puniſh, and <hi>the people ſhall fall.</hi> 3. Falſe worſhip is very licentious, in that not only God plagueth it with looſeneſſe, but in that it doth allow and foſter much fleſhly liberty; For, <hi>they ſacrifice with harlots,</hi> not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue they avowed harlots, and yet follow that forme of worſhip; but in their ſolemne ſacrifices, they ſtand not to joyne with har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, in feaſting them with the ſacrifices, and courting of them. 4. Let Idolaters joyne never ſo many fleſhly pleaſures with their worſhip, yet God will have no communion with ſuch, but will plead with them as renouncers of his Covenant, and of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; For, <hi>they are ſeparated,</hi> (to wit, from God) <hi>with whores, &amp;c.</hi> 5 Idolaters, how learned ſoever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be, or really are, yet in effect they are but brutiſh and ignorant.

When men once decline from the rule of Gods Word in chooſing a way of worſhip, they are readily given up to be endleſſe in multiplying defection by ſuch devices: the ſame vanity of minde, and the ſame principles of policy that lead them wrong in one ſtep may draw on more: beſide, that they felt inſufficiency of all falſe wayes, to quiet the conſcience, draweth men to a reſtleſſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of theſe courſes; therefore it is that <hi>Iſrael</hi> do adde <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> to the former places of their publick worſhip, and other places alſo, as is before explained. 3.

Whoever make defection from God and his way, yet he will not want a people to embrace him and his way; ſo much alſo may we learn, in that this exhortation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever directed to <hi>Judah,</hi> yet is ſpoken to <hi>Iſrael</hi> at firſt; <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, &amp;c.</hi> as defying her to deprive him of a people when ſhe had done her worſt, and when he ſhould at laſt make her <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> becauſe of her ſins; for albeit ſome in <hi>Judah</hi> might make defection to their way, and ſometime his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was interrupted there by their wicked Kings; yet they ſhould have the face of a true Church, and warrantable Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, during the time of his patience toward them, as is more expreſſely held out, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.12. 6. No pretence will ſerve to juſtifie or cover an unwarrantable way of worſhip, nor doth the Lords manifeſtation of himſelf in a place, by any ſpecial act of power or favour, warrant men to make uſe thereof as more holy then others, or, under that pretext abuſe it to ſuperſtition; for, it was upon theſe grounds <hi>Iſrael</hi> made uſe of <hi>Gilgal</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> for the place of their worſhip, and yet <hi>Judah</hi> is diſſwaded from it, as one of the ſinful courſes of <hi>Iſrael; Come not ye unto Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven or Bethel,</hi> which ſtood on ſome height, and therefore they did go up to it. 7. Places and things do loſe all their honour and eminencie when they are abuſed to idolatry; <hi>Bethel,</hi> the houſe of God, becomes <hi>Beth-aven,</hi> the houſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114928:47"/>
of vanity, or of iniquity; which is a name taken from a place near to <hi>Bethel, Joſhua</hi> 7.2. 8. Such as would be free of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or infection thereby, ought to abſtain from coming to the very places, where there is danger of infection, unleſſe that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity, and a clear call draw them; for, ſo is <hi>Judah</hi>'s du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; <hi>Come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven.</hi> 9. The Lord will not have his worſhip mixed with idolatrous courſes, nor is ſuperſtition or idolatry the more warrantable or imitable, that it is done under the pretence of ſerving God thereby; for, albeit <hi>ſwearing, The Lord liveth,</hi> be lawful, and a part of his worſhip, and ſometime put for all of it: yet it is forbidden <hi>Judah, nor ſwear, The Lord liveth,</hi> to wit, in theſe places, and the meaning is, pretend not to mixe my worſhip with the rites uſed there, nor be ye taken up with their way, though they pretend to worſhip the true God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> did when he made the golden calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5. 10. As mens preſuming to preſcribe wayes, and be changelings in the matters of Religion, is a fruit of wantonneſſe and idleneſſe of minde, having little to do: ſo the conſideration of mens wantonneſſe in ſinning, may deterre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from it if they be of ſober ſpirits; for, it is an argument to diſſwade <hi>Judah</hi> from this way of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for, <hi>in this Iſrael ſlideth back as a back-ſliding heifer;</hi> that is, this courſe is an evidence of <hi>Iſraels</hi> rebellion, as a wanton heifer that caſts the yoke, and therefore is not to be imitated. 11. Such as are ſo bent on liberty and licentiouſneſſe, as they can endure no yoke of God, may meet with liberty enough little to their profit: God can give them the world to wander through in exile, who would not be bounded with the Law; he can lay them open to felt and feared dangers, who placed all happineſſe in being rid of his yoke; and he can make them weak and faint-hearted in trouble, who were ſtrong and ſtout-hearted to ſin; for, <hi>the Lord will feed them,</hi> (not by taking care of them, though that in ſome reſpect be true; but in place of their reſidence in their own land, he will drive them into exile, and make their paſture to be) <hi>as a Lamb,</hi> (not any more a wanton ſtrong heifer) <hi>in a large place,</hi> where by its bleating alone, it ſhall bewray its own ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, danger and fear, and where it ſhall be expoſed as a prey, and not know where to turn it. 12. When defection from God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the height of wantonneſſe and rebellion againſt him, and rejecting of his yokes, then judgement is not far off; for, <hi>now the Lord will feed them, &amp;c.</hi> that is, ſhortly. 13. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the preſent condition of back-ſliders, which might
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114928:48"/>
tempt others to joyne with them, yet a ſerious conſideration of the certain conſequents of ſuch a courſe, may break that ſnare; therefore, however <hi>Judah</hi> for preſent, might be tempted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſucceſſe, yet the Lord propounds this as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to diſſwade them, that <hi>now the Lord will feed them as a Lambe in a large place,</hi>

                     <p>The ſixth and laſt article of the accuſation is againſt their Kingly tribe, called by the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> becauſe the firſt, and many of their following Kings were of that tribe, and it is conceived that <hi>Samaria</hi> their chief city ſtood in that tribe. The accuſation hath two branches; in the firſt whereof, they are charged with being ſo mad on idolatry, that they are become deſperate and irrecoverable. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As mens great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath its own ſnares to ſin accompanying it; ſo however they think themſelves above the reach of any challenge or cenſure; yet the Lord will not ſpare the ſins of the greateſt, as being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ring-leaders and chief maſters in the ſins of a land; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he challenge <hi>Ephraim,</hi> eſpecially for idolatry, which he actively carried on by reaſon of his State intereſts. 2. Idolatry is a very bewitching ſin, and doth keep where it gets a grip; for, <hi>Ephraim is joyned to idols,</hi> or glued to them, that he cannot any more be divided from them: for, albeit his politick intereſt drew him that way at firſt, yet being engaged, not only that, but a ſpirit of whoredome and Gods judgements keeps him to it, as a way moſt agreeable to his own heart. 3. As the Lord will at laſt give up deſperate and incorrigible ſinners to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their own wayes, ſo to be thus left is the chiefeſt of miſeries: Men need no more to make them miſerable, but to get leave to want a check from conſcience or the Miniſtery of the Word, or from Providence; for, ſaith he, <hi>let him alone,</hi> that is, not ſo much, thou <hi>Judah</hi> have no converſe with him; of which ſufficient hath been ſpoken on <hi>v.</hi> 15. as, let him go on without any further reproving of him.</p>

Their covetouſneſſe and corrupting of juſtice thereby. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the great madneſſe of the children of men, that if they attain to any greatneſſe, they make it ſhine in nothing but in eminent beaſtly ſins, as if all grandour conſiſted in this, as here we ſee in theſe great ones in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. Mens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing of the good creatures of God, and diſtempering their own bodies through intemperance, is an iniquity for which God will reckon with the greateſt; for, it is a challenge, <hi>their drink is ſoure,</hi> or <hi>gone,</hi> to wit, from its native ſavour and taſte, being putrified in their ſtomack, ſo that they cannot digeſt it. 3.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter, (which with the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are conceived to be one Sermon) the Lord proceeds in the ſame method, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes the ſame controverſie, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the former chapter, only with this difference; 1. <hi>Judah</hi> is here joyned with <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> becauſe that defection had flowed from <hi>Iſrael</hi> to them, and chiefly, becauſe that under <hi>Ahaz,</hi> (to whoſe times this prophecie agrees beſt) they had made ſome defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 2. The threatenings here are ſweetened with a prediction of their being drawn thereby at laſt to repentance, <hi>v.</hi> 15. which was not mentioned in the former chapter.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part of this chapter, (which relates to <hi>Iſrael</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,) the Lord having called all ranks to hear his proceſſe and ſentence, <hi>v.</hi> 1. — doth accuſe their rulers and teachers eſpecially, for enſnaring the people in ſin, <hi>v.</hi>— 1. and all ranks for their ſubtilty and deep rootedneſſe in oppreſſion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all admonitions and corrections, <hi>v.</hi> 2. for their idolatry and pollution, (which God knew, however they cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) <hi>v.</hi> 3. for their obſtinacy and impenitency in ſin, by reaſon of a ſpirit of whoredome, and their affected ignorance of God, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and for their great pride under all this ſinne, <hi>v.</hi> 5.— becauſe of which, the Lord threatens to deſtroy the Rulers and people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> with them, <hi>v.</hi>—5. at which time, multitude of ſacrifices ſhould not availe them, <hi>v.</hi> 6. but God ſhould ſhortly conſume them and all their wealth, who had ſo perfidiouſly violate the Covenant, and propagate ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to their children, <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſhould alarm them with ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies coming againſt them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and ſhould utterly deſtroy the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to his irrevocable ſentence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them, <hi>v.</hi> 9. In the ſecond part of the chapter, the Lord comes to deal with the two Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> more diſtinctly. And firſt, he ſpeaks to them ſeverally; accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <hi>Judah,</hi> and eſpecially their Rulers for the violation of all lawes, for which he threatens them with a deluge of wrath, <hi>v.</hi> 10.

and accuſing <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their voluntary defection in Religion for the which they were and ſhould be juſtly oppreſſed by their own Princes, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Secondly, he ſpeaks to them conjunctly; accuſing them for the ill uſe they made of corrections; that whereas the Lord did by inſenſible wayes conſume them for their ſins, <hi>v.</hi> 12. they run to humane helps, <hi>v.</hi> 13.— which as they had and would diſappoint them, <hi>v.</hi> — 13. ſo the Lord was hereby provoked to deal more ſeverely with them, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and to abandon them till they ſhould turn and ſeek him; as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth they ſhall do, <hi>v.</hi> 15.</p>

                     <p>In this verſe, we have firſt a citation of all ranks to come to judgement, or to hear Gods judicial proceſſe and ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. 2. The firſt article of his accuſation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth chiefly their Prieſts and Rulers, that they had been as ſnares and nets on <hi>Mizphah</hi> and <hi>Tabor.</hi> The firſt of which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, (though there were cities of that name, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.38. and 18.26.) ſeemeth here to have been an hill in <hi>Gilead,</hi> and near <hi>Hermon,</hi> See, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11.23. <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.29. and the other was an hill in <hi>Galilee, Judg.</hi> 4.6. the ſenſe of the accuſation is not ſo much, that they laid wait to entrap any who would go up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip; none of theſe places being fit for that enterprize; nor yet that they enſnared innocents to take away their lives and eſtates, of which, <hi>v.</hi> 2. but the plain meaning is, that as fowlers and hunters lay ſnares and nets for birds and beaſts on theſe mountains; ſo their Prieſts and Rulers by their erroneous doctrine, fraudulent counſels, ſubtile edicts, their prophane example and countenancing of ſin, did deceive the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and enſnare them to follow idolatry. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is no rank, but they will be found to have guiltineſſe to lay to heart, in a time when God pleads a controverſie with a land, which is a very ſad caſe; for, <hi>the Prieſts,</hi> ſuch as they were, <hi>the Houſe of Iſrael,</hi> or body of the Nation, and <hi>the houſe of the Kings</hi> are called to hear; and albeit the Princes and Prieſts drew
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114928:50"/>
away the people, yet that doth not free them. See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. 2. As the Word of God doth reach and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige all ranks of perſons, be in what eminencie they will; and as the Lords faithful ſervants muſt preach againſt the ſins of all, without reſpect of perſons; ſo the general over-ſpreading of ſin, (however it harden every particular ſinner, yet) is no way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape judgements, but rather to haſten them; therefore doth <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> challenge all, as being obliged to hear and obey, and to ſhew how juſtly God was angry, when all ranks had corrupted their way. 3. When God is coming againſt a people in judgement, it concernes them to be very ſerious in conſidering what he ſaith from his Word, and he will at laſt force audience and attention from the moſt ſtubborn; ſo much may we gather from theſe many calls, to <hi>heare, hearken and give eare,</hi> with the reaſon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>for judgement is toward you,</hi> or to be pronounced and executed againſt you, as ſhewing, it became them to hear, and however they ſhould be made to do it. See, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.4, 6. 4. The Lords contending with his people by his Word, is not an ordinary challenge, as of one diſpleaſed only, but the judicial procedure and ſentence of the Supreme Judge, which will end in execution; for, his controverſie is <hi>judgement toward you,</hi> that is, a judicial proceſſe and ſentence, making way for due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution. 5. God may teſtifie much of his anger againſt a people, in the Teachers and Rulers he giveth them, as being fit means to ripen them for judgement; for, ſo proved the Prieſts and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 6. Subtile ſnares and inſinuations are more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for drawing men wrong, then open violence is: for, thus did they miſlead <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were <hi>a ſnare and a net ſpread.</hi> 7. It is a great ſin in men, and cauſe of Gods controverſie, when they prove a ſnare to others, or by their inſinuations, example or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie draw them to ſin againſt God; for, <hi>judgement is toward you, becauſe you have been a ſnare on Mizpah, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>In the ſecond place, (which may comprehend all ranks) he accuſeth them, that they were moſt ſubtile in their projects and devices to compaſſe; and in their pretences, excuſes and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, to cover their bloody oppreſſions and facts, and that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114928:51"/>

As mens ſubtile conveyances in ſinning, and their parts in palliating of it, prove ſnares to themſelves to harden them ſo much the more in it; ſo to be deeply rooted and engaged in a courſe of ſinning, is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation thereof; ſo much alſo may be imported in that they <hi>are profound to make ſlaughter,</hi> or have taken deep root in that courſe; as, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 9.9. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.6. which is in part occaſioned by their ſubtile way of it, 4. Apoſtates and revolters from God, are ordinarily given up to be groſſeſt in their courſe; to be bloody and cruel without a check or ſcruple, to be plagued with abilities to compaſſe their ends, and to defend their wayes, and to be moſt deeply plunged in ill courſes; for, it is <hi>the revolters,</hi> who <hi>are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found to make ſlaughter.</hi> 5. As it is of the Lords great mercy, that he gives free warning to his Church of her danger, and ſends out leſſer corrections to reclaim her: ſo ſin after ſuch dealing becomes very ſinful; for, it is an aggravation of their way, that they went on, <hi>though I have been a rebuker,</hi> (or <hi>correction,</hi> as the word alſo ſignifieth) <hi>of them all.</hi> 6. When men once breed themſelves to contemn the Word of God, and to deſpiſe inſtruction by his corrections, it is not only an evidence they are deeply engaged in groſſe ſin, but then certainly groſſeſt courſes will follow on it; for, they are then <hi>profound to make ſlaughter,</hi> when he had been a <hi>rebuker</hi> or <hi>correcter,</hi> but without effect.</p>

It is no ſtrange thing to ſee wicked men ignorant of themſelves, deceived with their own hearts, and hardened in their ſin, by reaſon of the falſe gloſſes they put upon it, to blinde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others: for, this aſſertion, <hi>I know Ephraim, &amp;c.</hi> ſuppoſeth that they were not known to themſelves, and that they dreamed to blinde others as themſelves were. 2.

                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114928:52"/>A fourth challenge, (which is alſo an aggravation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) is, for their being obſtinately impenitent and incurable in their ſin, through long cuſtome in it, through a ſpirit, or ſtrong inclination to whoredome or idolatry, and through their affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorance of God. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a great aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, when men not only do fall in it, but do impenitently and obſtinately perſiſt in it; for, it is a challenge and aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the former, that <hi>they will not turne to God.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.4, 5. 2. It doth yet more aggreage mens impenitencie, that God, to whom they will not turne, hath been their God by their Profeſſion, and by his tender care of them, and that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers yet to prove himſelf their God if they will return; for, it addes to the challenge, <hi>that they will not turne to their God;</hi> and indeed deſpiſed and abuſed mercy will be one of the bittereſt ingredients in the challenges againſt the Church. 3. A peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are yet the more inexcuſable in their impenitencie, when they will not ſo much as think on endeavouring or uſing the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry outward means, which might tend toward repentance; for, <hi>they will not frame their doings to turn:</hi> they might have ſought, and yet not come ſpeed, becauſe of their unſoundneſſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in their way, but they were either ſo ignorant, or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impious, as they did not ſo much as endeavour to bend their courſe that way. 4. Cuſtome in ſin is a great ſlavery, and cauſe of impenitence, and is a judgement, to which ſuch as delight in ſin are given up; for, ſo the words will alſo reade, <hi>their doings will not give</hi> (or ſuffer) <hi>them to turn;</hi> which is the firſt cauſe of their impenitencie, flowing from what followeth. See, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. 5. It is juſt with God to give Apoſtates up to the violent inclination of their own ſpirits, and to a ſpirit of Satan to poſſeſſe their hearts, which will drive them on to follow ſin madly, and render them incorrigible; for, it is another cauſe of their impenitencie, and that from which the former flowes; for, <hi>a ſpirit of whoredome is in the midſt of them,</hi> or hath poſſeſſed their heart and very inwards; <hi>whoredomes</hi> may be underſtood here either generally for theſe unlawful courſes to which mens luſts drive them, and to which the incorrigible are given up, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. or more particularly, for their frequent and multiplied idolatries, (as, <hi>chap.</hi> 4.12.) from which flowed their other debordings, and becauſe of which they were given up to them. 6. Such as do depart from God, and perſiſt in that way, do proclaim their ignorance of God, either of what beauty and excellency is in him above all choices, or of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114928:52"/>
toward his people, or dreadfulneſſe againſt back-ſliders; and whatever knowledge of theſe things men ſeem to have, yet cuſtome in ſin, and a whoriſh ſpirit will ſoon baniſh it; for, it is added as another cauſe of their impenitencie, following upon the former; <hi>and they have not known the Lord.</hi>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>A fifth challenge, (and yet a further aggravation of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer) is, for their notorious pride under all this ſin, of which they are elſewhere noted as guilty, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. Hereunto is ſubjoyned Gods ſentence for theſe ſins; to wit, that both the Kingly tribe and Nation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould be ruined according as their iniquities do deſerve, and that <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould alſo ſhare with them in that judgement; which though in its full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, it do reach to their deſtruction by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> if not further, as may be gathered from <hi>v.</hi> 15. where it ſeems to take in all the calamities that ſhall come upon them, previous to their future converſion; yet in this place it ſeems chiefly to point at the calamities that were to come on <hi>Judah,</hi> when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould fall, and they <hi>with them;</hi> that as when <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe was cut off, <hi>Judah</hi> who had affinity with them, taſted of the ſtroak, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.27. and 10.12, 13, 14. ſo <hi>Judah</hi> having joyned with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their ſins (as may in part be gathered from <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.13.) ſhould alſo ſmart at the fall of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by the ſame Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, as is recorded in the hiſtory, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.9,—13. and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetickly lamented, <hi>Mic.</hi> 1. and thus in regard <hi>Judah</hi> hath not yet been challenged in this chapter, we are to look on this threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as laid on <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſcore, who drew <hi>Judah</hi> to this ſin and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is a great aggravation of ſin, when men are ſwelled with conceit under it, ſo that their thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are nothing leſſened, but they dare defend ſin, pleaſe themſelves in it, and riſe againſt ſuch as do reprove it, and be filled with proud impatience under corrections inflicted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it; for, ſuch was their temper, there is <hi>the pride of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> notwithſtanding all they did. 2. As pride is a ſin that will not conceal it ſelf, ſo this ſort of pride is a notorious proof of mens guiltineſſe which will juſtly condemn them, and plead for God in ſo doing; for, <hi>the pride of Iſrael doth teſtifie to his
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114928:53"/>
face,</hi> or plead him guilty, let him deny it as he will; and for God, however he quarrel him; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.9. 3. Sin will certainly bring on ruine, eſpecially when men are not only obſtinate in it, but ſwelled with pride for all that; This however men think to be great by it, yet it will bring them down from their grandour; For, <hi>Therefore</hi> (becauſe of the former ſins, and particularly their pride,) <hi>ſhall Ephraim and Iſrael fall.</hi> 4. Gods judgements will be univerſal on all ranks, according as they have ſinned; and when he pleads, none will be able to help another; nor will they who were ſnares to others, either ſecure them, or themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Gods ſtroak; nor will the enſnared be able to plead exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: For, both <hi>Ephraim</hi> (the Kingly tribe, who miſled the reſt,) <hi>and Iſrael</hi> (or, the miſled people,) <hi>ſhall fall.</hi> 5. As ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is the cauſe of mens coming down from an eminent and flouriſhing, to a baſe condition, and ſhould be obſerved to be ſo: So calamity will diſcover what a filthy courſe ſin is, when men ſhall be plunged in the effects thereof; For, they ſhall not only <hi>fall becauſe of their iniquity,</hi> as the words will read, but <hi>in their iniquity,</hi> or in a puddle of judgements flowing from it, whereby they ſhall ſee what a filthy courſe ſin was, and how it abaſed and made them fall, though they would not ſee it before. 6. Even ſuch as the Lord hath moſt ſpecial intereſt in, and given ſpecial promiſes unto, will not get free more then others, with whom, or after whoſe example, they fall in ſin; For, notwithſtanding the promiſe made to <hi>Judah, ch.</hi> 1.7. yet upon theſe grounds it is threatned, <hi>Judah alſo ſhall fall with them.</hi> 7. It may juſtly adde to the miſery of ſinners, that they are not only plagued themſelves, but that they have been a ſnare to draw others to the ſame ſin and ruine with them; Therefore it is added to <hi>Iſraels</hi> calamity, that <hi>Judah alſo ſhall fall with them.</hi>

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114928:53"/>
of the miſery to follow thereupon may be ſeen. The firſt ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is, that the heap of their ſacrifices ſhould not recal this ſentence, nor bring any mitigation of their trouble, nor procure acceſſe to God or his favour, who had juſtly deſerted them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Greateſt contemners of God, and deſpiſers of repentance, may at laſt ſtand ſenſibly in need of him, and their ſtraits may drive them to make ſome faſhion of repentance, who yet were never put to it by any true ſenſe of ſin; For, even they who would <hi>not frame their doings to turne to God,</hi> v. 4. are now brought to <hi>go ſeek the Lord.</hi> 2. As ſuperſtitious and corrupt men will ſpare no coſt in external performances in their corrupt way, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.6, 7. So impenitent ſinners may make offer of many things, when yet they do not give themſelves to God; For, <hi>They ſhall go with their flocks, and with their herds to ſeek the Lord;</hi> they will let him carve upon theſe, and let him take as many as he pleaſeth of them, and yet we finde no offer of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or to cut off one luſt. 3. As external ordinances are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed not to be reſted on, but that God may be found in them; ſo it will be the ſad plague of ſuch as ſeek God in a wrong way, or are too late and unſound in ſeeking, not to finde God in their ſtraits, For, <hi>they ſhall go to ſeek the Lord,</hi> in and by theſe ſacrifices, <hi>but they ſhall not finde him,</hi> as being but ſuperſtitious worſhippers, and ſuch as are unſound and too late in beginning. 4. As it is a very ſad ſtroak, when the Lord is not only away, and not to be found to a peoples ſenſe, but he hath really deſerted them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.6. So however men cannot eaſily diſcerne, nor lay to heart Gods judicial deſerting of them, while they are hot and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ſinning, yet in ſtraits they will be made ſadly to feel it; Therefore it is added, <hi>he hath withdrawen himſelf from them,</hi> to ſhew that they were really deſerted, and that they ſhould finde it ſo in ſtraits, however they felt it not before, as <hi>Samſon</hi> knew not his caſe, when he ſlept in <hi>Delilahs</hi> boſome, till the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines</hi> were upon him, <hi>Judg,</hi> 16.10.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond amplification of their guilt, and the ſentence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon, is, that ſince they had perfidiouſly violate the Covenant betwixt God and them, and had propagate their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to their poſterity, and ſo made them ſtrangers to God; therefore in a ſhort time he would conſume them and all their wealth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Churches defections are againſt ſo many obligations, engagements and profeſſions to God, that juſtly treachery may be charged upon them; For, <hi>They have dealt treacherouſly againſt the Lord:</hi> not that any can betray him, or diſappoint his expectation, but that they do contrary to what in all reaſon might be expected of them. 2. It is a peculiar point of treachery againſt God, to pervert and corrupt our children who are his by Covenant, and who are committed to our charge, that they may be forth coming to him; Therefore this is given as an inſtance of their treachery, <hi>for they have begoteen ſtrange children,</hi> or ſtrangers to him, being educate in Idolatry. 3. The corrupting of young ones, and poiſoning of the ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a ſad preſage and token of approaching vengeance and utter deſolation; For, upon this the threatening of being <hi>devoured</hi> is given out. 4. As the earth and things thereof, is all the portion that wicked men either get or crave: So the Lord can (and being provoked will) in a ſhort time reach the enjoyer and his enjoyments, and cut them off: For, <hi>now ſhall a moneth,</hi> (or ſhort time, as, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8.) <hi>devoure them and their portions,</hi> or what befell every one of them as a portion at the dividing of the land, which now they reſted on.

The Lord hath a day, wherein men who will not hear nor regard challenges from the Word, ſhall be made to know the force of his rebukes in a language which they will underſtand; For this cauſe is <hi>Iſraels</hi> overthrow called <hi>the day of rebuke,</hi> or <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</hi> 2. When the Word, or moderate corrections will not availe, it is juſt with God to put an end to the courſe of ſin, if it were with the utter deſolation of the incorrigible: For, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim ſhall be deſolate in the day of rebuke;</hi> That alarm, <hi>v.</hi> 8. ſhould neither prove falſe, nor a momentanie oppreſſion only, as it was on <hi>Judah;</hi> but ſhould end in their utter deſolation. 3 As it is of the Lords goodneſſe, that he warnes ſinners of their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: So it is their duty to lay to heart the truth of that warning: And however the Word be but little heeded when it threatens, yet men continuing in ſin, will finde the truth of it by effects: For, this ſeals up all, <hi>among the tribes of Iſrael have I made knowne that which ſhall ſurely be,</hi> that is, I have given to all warning and intimation of this, which they ſhould look upon as certain, and (however they deſpiſe it) they will finde it certainly come to paſſe.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond part of the Chap the Lord comes more expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſpeak to both the Kingdomes of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and that both ſeverally and conjunctly. And firſt, as for <hi>Judah,</hi> whom he had threatened before, he accuſeth their Rulers eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, for violating all Lawes, divine, and humane, which ſet bounds to men in the matters of Religion and righteouſneſſe,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114928:55"/>
which being a great ſin, (as it is to remove ancient land-marks, and enter upon the poſſeſſion of others, of which See <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.14. &amp; 27.17:) doth juſtly provoke the Lord to threaten them with wrath in great abundance and violence, as a deluge of water o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing and overturning all. This ſin was eminently to be found in <hi>Ahaz</hi> his practice, as is to be ſeen in the Hiſtory. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God in his abſolute Sovereignty hath ſet bounds and limits to men in the matter of their eſtates, Religion, and duties of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which it is not lawfull to tranſgreſſe; For, ſo much doth this challenge, with the alluſion to the removing of land-markes, teach. 2. Men are naturally ſo perverſe, that ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bounds ſet by God will be ſo farre from keeping them in, that they are thereby irritate to break them the more, and the words prohibitions do but put an edge on their humours to runne the more violently wrong: For, they are <hi>like them that remove the bound;</hi> though Lawes be ſet down more ſacred then land-markes, yet they will encroach upon them. 3. Albeit great men think they may make bold with Gods Law above others, and ſo are ill examples to all others; yet their greatneſſe gives them no allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, nor will ſhelter them in ſo doing; For, it is held out as a challenge, that <hi>the Princes of Judah were like them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the bound.</hi> 4.

It is righteous with God to let out wrath without bound or moderation, and in great violence on theſe who will not be held in by any bond or Law preſcribed by him: For, <hi>therefore,</hi> becauſe they remove all bounds, <hi>I will poure out my wrath on them like water,</hi> or largely, like a deluge which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently overflowes all banks.

                     <p>Secondly, as for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he accuſeth the bodie of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (under the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> not here taken onely or ſo much for the Kingly tribe) for their obeying the injunction of their Rulers in changing of their Religion, and that they did it willingly and without compulſion.

Such as uſurpe unto themſelves power in the civill ſtate, have ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily woful injunctions in the matters of God, and of Religion; partly, that they may (as they think,) mould it ſo as may tend to the ſafety of their affaires; and partly, that in Gods judgement they may more eminently engage him againſt them for all their iniquities: For, ſuch was <hi>the comandement of Jeroboam</hi> and his ſucceſſors here mentioned. 2. No command of men, even of Rulers, will excuſe ſin, eſpecially in matters of Religion, but obedience to what they command may oft-times be the cauſe of Gods controverſie againſt a people; For, it is a challenge againſt <hi>Ephraim, becauſe he walked after the commandement,</hi> and gave obedience to it. 3. Albeit it be enough to prove a courſe ſinful, that it is againſt Law, whether it be expreſſely voluntary or not, yet God looks on mens willingneſſe as a great aggravation of ſin, particularly of Apoſtaſy: For here it is the challenge, <hi>he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly walked, &amp;.</hi> 4. Albeit it be a moſt hainous and eminently voluntary ſin, when men fully conſent to it of their own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; yet a ſinne doth not ceaſe to be altogether voluntary, even when commands of men attended with preſent dangers and terrours, draweth them to conſent; far leſſe when the ſimple command of men obtaines their full and free conſent; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit there was a <hi>commandment,</hi> becauſe of which they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend terrour, yet as it was not terrour that prevailed with them, ſo the Lord ſeeth that, and that they did it <hi>willingly,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that; for it was of their own conſent, that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of <hi>Iſrael</hi> made defection at <hi>Jeroboams</hi> beck. 5. The body of a people, as they are naturally moſt prone and willing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114928:56"/>
to what is ill; ſo are they eaſily miſled, and carried any way that it pleaſeth theſe who have power over them; For, ſo is here laid to the charge of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or the generality of them, though ſome did otherwiſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.16. 6. Such as do corrupt the worſhip of God for their carnal ends, are ordinarily great oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; and however they may flatter people till they gain their ends, yet then they will cruſh them; For, albeit <hi>Jeroboam</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the rent, under pretence of ridding the people of great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and invented a way of Religion, pretending the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eaſe, yet by him and his ſucceſſors, <hi>Ephraim is oppreſſed and broken in judgement,</hi> not only in the righteous judgement of God, but in the adminiſtration of juſtice, they were cruſhed and oppreſſed by their corrupt Rulers, who were great bribers, <hi>c.</hi> 4.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>8. This is ſpoken of in the preſent time, becauſe they had already ſadly felt it, as a pledge of more of that uſage. 7.

We may take up this purpoſe thus; when the Lord did puniſh them for their ſins, eſpecially by more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible rods, like a moth in cloth, and rottenneſſe in a tree, that ſo they might be drawn to repent, <hi>v.</hi> 12. they on the contrary, when they felt their diſeaſe, did ſeek to humane helps to aſſert them out of trouble, but were in juſtice diſappointed, <hi>v.</hi> 13. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was provoked by their abuſe of the rod, and miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age under it, to deal more ſeverely with them, as accordingly he threatens to do, <hi>v.</hi> 14. The Original in <hi>v</hi> 12. hath only, <hi>I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ephraim as a moth, &amp;c.</hi> but whether we ſupply it, <hi>I will be,</hi> by way of threatening for the future, or <hi>I have been,</hi> (which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth beſt with the next <hi>ver.</hi> where he challengeth them for their miſcarriage under ſuch a diſpenſation already committed,) all cometh to this, that whether the Lord had, or would inflict ſuch a ſtroak, yet this their miſcarriage would certainly follow on it, to the drawing down of more wrath upon themſelves. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be conſidered, that <hi>v.</hi> 12. doth not begin in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal with <hi>Therefore,</hi> as if it contained a ſentence for the former ſin, (though indeed the ſtroak be the fruit of ſin,) but with <hi>and,</hi> which in that language is only a tranſition to a new purpoſe, as here it begins a new challenge. From <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord needs no more to undo a people, but a very inſenſible curſe, whether of inward diſſenſions, or blaſting mens ſpirits, counſels and eſtates in a ſecret unfelt way; Therefore did he only ſend <hi>a moth to Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>rottenneſſe,</hi> or <hi>a worme to the houſe of Judah,</hi> whereby we may underſtand the many inteſtine confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and forreigne invaſions of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> antecedent to their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and the many troubles of <hi>Judah,</hi> partly from <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and partly from the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which are recorded in the Sacred Hiſtory, which whatever impreſſion they made, yet ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but little, as to the utter overthrowing of theſe Kingdomes. He compareth his ſtroak on <hi>Ephraim</hi> to <hi>a moth,</hi> and on <hi>Judah</hi> to <hi>a worme</hi> or <hi>rottenneſſe,</hi> it may be becauſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> was ſooner to be deſtroyed, as a moth doth eat cloath, and <hi>Judah</hi> was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt longer, (as a tree doth, albeit it be worm-eaten,) though it was to be deſtroyed at laſt. 2. Whatever judgements be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a people, it is their duty to look upon them as the fruit of their own way, and coming of themſelves; For, the <hi>moth</hi> breeds of the cloath it conſumeth, and <hi>rottenneſſe,</hi> or <hi>the worme,</hi> of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114928:57"/>
tree. 3. God is to be looked on in judgements inflicted, not as an idle ſpectator, or a ſimple permitter only, but as an active worker, and inflicter of what we deſerve; For, ſaith he, <hi>I will be,</hi> or <hi>have been as a moth,</hi> that is, I will inflict a ſtroak like to that. 4. As the Lords mercy may be read in the midſt of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming wrath when he begins with moderate ſtroaks, and doth conſume but ſlowly; ſo the ſtudy of this mercy ought to invite ſuch as are ſo ſtricken to repentance: For, this is the ſcope of this purpoſe, to aggreage their ſin, who being thus moderately ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and not totally, and in a moment conſumed, yet they did not make right uſe thereof, but went further wrong. From <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Albeit the Lords judgements do bring on ſad trouble, yet this is not ſoon ſeen or laid to heart; For, <hi>When Ephraim ſaw his ſickneſſe, and Judah ſaw his wound,</hi> imports that they ſaw it not at firſt, albeit they were ſick and wounded. It is a peculiar plague accompanying inſenſible judgements inward or outward, that they are not ſoon laid to heart. And under any judgements mens ſelfiſhneſſe will hide the ſight of common ſtroakes, and their ſtupidity and obduration make them little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their own or a Lands caſe; See <hi>Ex.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.15 <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. 2. It will be but to little purpoſe that men ſee their caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, when they ſee only their diſtreſſe, but not the cauſes thereof; for this was the cauſe of their miſcarriage, that they ſaw their <hi>ſickneſſe and wound,</hi> and no more. Such a temper will rather reſolve in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe; pining away under judgements, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.23. and more provocation, then in turning to God. 3. Where men get not the right ſight or uſe of corrections, they will become the worſe for them, and ſuch as feel trouble, but take not up the cauſe of it, will readily run to ill ſhifts, neglecting the true remedy, and ſo increaſe their own guilt; For, ſo was it here, <hi>Ephraim</hi> (not ſecluding <hi>Judah</hi>) added to his ſin, and <hi>went to the Aſſyrian, and ſent to King Jareb,</hi> he <hi>went,</hi> when he ſent Ambaſſadours. This name <hi>Jareb,</hi> uſed here, &amp; <hi>ch.</hi> 10.6. (and ſignifying one that ſhall plead, or avenge, or aſſert out of trouble) ſeemeth either to have been a common name to all the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Kings, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the Kings of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or that this was the deſignation given by them when they ſent to him; they acknowledged him their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and he whom only they truſted to plead their cauſe, and aſſert them out of their miſeries. Of this ſee what is recorded both of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.19. &amp; 16.6, 7. 4. It is a ſpeciall proof of the naughtineſſe of mens hearts, and of the little uſe they get of corrections, when they dare have recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114928:58"/>
and reſt upon humane helps, neglecting God who is purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a controverſie for ſin: For, herein was <hi>Ephraims</hi> miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, <hi>he went to the Aſſyrian, &amp;c.</hi> 5. True repentance is ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a path, and ſo contrary to mens nature, that they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſſay any mean, then come to God under trouble; For, ſo much doth the practice of this people teach. 6. Where God is a party, and purſuing for ſin, humane helps will prove uſeleſſe ſo long as he is ſlighted, and they reſted on: For, the <hi>Aſſyrian could not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.</hi> From <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Humane helps do prove uſeleſſe in a day of trouble, not only becauſe of their own emptineſſe and inſufficiency, but becauſe God is provoked to anger by mens leaning to them; Therefore is the reaſon given why they could not cure, <hi>For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion,</hi> and this is to be ſeen chiefly in ſuch diſappointments. 2. When men make no uſe of leſſer cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, but neglecting true remedies, do ſeek to ſinfull remedies, and reſt on creature-helps; they do hereby heighten their own guilt and trouble, and do provoke God, not only to let former troubles lie on, and to diſappoint their expectations, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their calamities; For, it is added, that not only the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> could not cure them, but the moth turned into a lion; <hi>I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the houſe of Judah.</hi> It is not very needful, to make a diſtinction betwixt <hi>the lion,</hi> and <hi>young lion,</hi> as if <hi>Judahs</hi> ſtroak were compared to tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a young lion, becauſe it continued not ſo long as <hi>Iſraels:</hi> For, (though that proved true, yet) the ſcope in both is ſimply to point out a ſtroak that ſhould utterly for once deſtroy them. 3. However it be the great ſin of men, to turne brutiſh in their oppreſſing others; yet Gods providence is holy, and his hand is to be ſeen in all of it: For, ſaith he, <hi>I will be as a lion,</hi> albeit it was the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Caldeans</hi> who were inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that beaſtly cruelty; and again, <hi>I, even I will teare, &amp;c.</hi> 4. God being provoked, is an invincible and ſore party, he will teare as a lion, go away with his prey without fear, when none dare or can reſcue; For, <hi>I will tear and go away: I will take away and none ſhall reſcue.</hi>

Gods ſore ſtroakes, and eſpecially his ſad deſertions, do call men to repentance, as being that which may be attained then; that which the godly (if the ſenſe of their condition be bleſſed to them) will be ſtirred up unto; and that which can promiſe a bleſſed iſſue of their condition to them: For, this is Gods end in all this, to draw them to the true reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, <hi>I will returne, till they acknowledge their offence.</hi> As the Lord will make trouble purſue his own eſpecially, till they come to the right uſe of it; So where his people are ſet on work this way by his withdrawing of himſelf, it is a token the deſertion is not total, but that the Lod hath left ſomewhat behinde him, that drawes them after him; whereas to be deſerted in trouble, in reſpect of duty, (when men either neglect means in ſuch a caſe, as, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13. or become more eſtranged from God that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts them, as, <hi>Zech.</hi> 11.8.) is more ſad then to be deſerted as to the want of ſenſible comfort and manifeſtations of God, when yet they are purſuing duty, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.13, 14. 3. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is then true, when men are indeed convinced of ſin, and driven to confeſſe and plead guilty before the Lord; and without this, much ſhew of prayer and ſervice by a ſinful people, will be but little worth: For, that is here expected, to <hi>acknowledge their offence,</hi> or, <hi>to be guilty,</hi> that is, that they not only make a ſhew of confeſſion, but that really before God, they be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of guilt, and look like a people who have ſuch a burden upon them. 4. Such as are really humbled under the ſenſe of guilt, ought alſo to turn real ſeekers of God, that is, to be ſuch as would not only be rid of preſent guilt, that they may get eaſe of trouble; but ſuch as ſet themſelves for time to come, to preſſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter communion with God, and walk in his way; and for that
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114928:59"/>
end, they muſt make God himſelf, and not ſiniſter ends, their ſcope in this courſe; they muſt be ſenſible of their diſtance from God, and purſue when they do not enjoy; yea, whatever they enjoy, they muſt ſtill be on the purſuit of more, while they are within time; All this is imported in that the Lord ſaith, <hi>they ſhall ſeek me.</hi> 5. Such as do ſeek God indeed, ought to be ardent and inſtant in it, taking hold of all opportunities, and purſuing after God, as him whom they may not want; and eſpecially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer negligence ought to be made up with doubled diligence, by ſuch as turne to God: So much is imported in that <hi>they will ſeek me early,</hi> and be betimes at it, when they are turned to God. 6. All theſe duties required in right ſeeking of God, ought to be eſpecially ſet about in ſad times. Times wherein affliction preſſe men hard on all hands, ought to be times of ſeeking God indeed, and ought to put an edge on diligence and duties, otherwiſe it may draw to a ſad account. For, <hi>in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> 7. Such as look toward God, ought not to be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that afflictions drive them to it, who ſought him not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and albeit afflictions firſt ſet us on duty; yet if when we come, God give us other earrands, it is a ſufficient proof of ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; For, it is foretold as the ſound converſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>in their affliction they will ſeek me early;</hi> albeit they ſought not before, and the croſſe drave them to it, yet it is ſound, ſince their erarand is to ſeek God. 8. Repentance is not only our duty, to endeavour it, but it is Gods promiſe who undertakes to work it in his own: And ſuch as minde repentance, ought to ſet about it in the faith of a promiſe, and eying him who only can produce it: For, it is a promiſe, <hi>they will ſeek me early,</hi> which though it relate particularly, to <hi>Iſraels</hi> future converſion; yet all the Lords people, as they are preſſed with need, may lay hold on it, and come to him who is exalted to give repentance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well as remiſſion of ſin, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31.</p>

                     <p>IN this firſt part of the Chap. the Lord inſiſts on the future repentance of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and brings them in as doing what he had promiſed of them, Chap. 5.15. Partly for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the godly in that time, to whom theſe ſad meſſages and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114928:60"/>
diſpenſations publiſhed by the Prophets, and performed before their eyes could not be inſupportable, unleſſe they had this ground of future hope: And partly to preſcribe unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation, a pattern of true repentance in the practice of theſe, who after them ſhould obtain mercy; that ſo they might not pleaſe themſelves with their own way of repentance, but might let about the duty in earneſt, if ſo be there might yet be hope.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>verſe</hi> containeth the mutuall exhortation, and up-ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one of another to repentance, and their firſt ground of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, which is; that though, while they were impenitent the Lord had ſmitten and torne them ſore, Chap. 5.12, 14. yet now upon their turning to him, he would, as a tender Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, binde up and heale all theſe wounds. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is true repentance, there will be <hi>a returning unto the Lord,</hi> which imports, 1. That a true penitent will be ſenſible not onely of ſtraying from God which hath made a diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and him; but that his ſtraying hath begotten an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſſe, and turned his back upon God; ſo that he needs to <hi>return.</hi> And particularly, he muſt be ſenſible of further ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under afflictions, which were ſent to reclaime him; as was their caſe, Chap. 5.13. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. 2. A penitent muſt have a deep ſenſe, that all other courſes he hath eſſayed in his ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God, are but vanity, that he hath been a loſer thereby, and that the Lord is onely worthy to be choſen and embraced; and therefore he <hi>returneth</hi> to him, as the onely excellent of choices. See, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.7. And 14.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.22, 23. &amp;c. 3. A pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent muſt have a through indeavour to make up this diſtance not being moved by affliction onely, or by ſin as it draweth on affliction; but by the want of God, whoſe favour he deſires to enjoy, and to come under his yoke; and not contenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with motions or fits in this endeavour, but ſtudying to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it forth till he come to a reall enjoyment of God, and <hi>ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the Lord</hi> indeed, which theſe penitents are yet endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, albeit already there be ſuch an edge upon them, as makes them ſtir up one another. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. As there is great need of upſtirring, for the right performance of the duty of repentance, which is a duty far above our reach, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7. So however love may prevent the Lords people in their very dead condition; yet the ordinary forerunner of a time of mercy, is the Lords ſtirring up his people to ſeek him; for, here they are excited, and exciting one another to this duty, <hi>come and let us
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114928:60"/>
return,</hi> and this is their temper in a time of love. See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.9, 10. 3. As it is a ſure evidence of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, when men are deeply convinced of the need of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and would have all to ſet about it, (as here they are;) and as true repentance and brotherly love, exciting one another go together, and want of love argues much impenitency: So it is a ſweet thing when the Lords people joyn hand in hand, and by their example and encouragement ſtir up one another to ſeek God; and times of mercy will be joyning times, and unite the Lords people in the duties of repentance; for ſuch will be their way in this time, <hi>Come, and let us return.</hi> See, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. 4. When a people once begin to decline from God, ordinarily they become deſperate in ſin, and are neere undone before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſible, or be drawn to God; for, ſo is ſuppoſed here they are <hi>torn</hi> and <hi>ſmitten</hi> before they are brought to need repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. See, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.18.—39. <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6,—11. Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie once given way unto, is not eaſily recovered, ſenſe of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and of ſin procuring them, is not ſoone attained, the bleſſing of afflictions is not taken up at our foot, our ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors raiſed by afflictions, in ſwelling againſt Providence, doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after ruined Idols, &amp;c. are not ſoone laid. So that it is no wonder matters draw to this height. 5. God is a ſevere pur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urer of ſin, when once he begins to proſecute a controverſie with a viſible Church; for, he will both <hi>ſmite</hi> and <hi>tare,</hi> and deale ſeverely before they return not. He is a conſuming fire, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. not to be provoked, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.31. His provoked love will end in jealous rage, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.8, His ſovereignty and power will not endure that men ſhould refuſe to receive correction from him, or think to prove ſtronger then he, in walking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. And his love will not want his people, though he ſhould purſue them with never ſo great ſeverity. 6. Sad ſtrookes which have been long inflicted on the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and yet they have continued ſtupid under them, may at laſt be bleſſed, and work upon them, to make them ſenſible and ſeek to God; for, now they not onely feel, but are driven to ſeek the true remedy of their afflictions, which they did not before, Chap. 5.13. Albeit our hearts, and afflictions of themſelves will never produce this, yet the Lords free-grace and bleſſing, accompanying afflictions will bring it about. See, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40, 41, &amp;c. 7. As the afflictions of the Church are from God, and to be taken as from his hand; ſo the healing thereof muſt come onely from him; for, <hi>He hath torn and he will
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114928:61"/>
heal us, &amp;c.</hi> God will not proceed in ſuch a way of judgement toward his people, as to deliver them from trouble, when yet they are not led to him thereby, or to obſcure his own love which doeth for them; but will blaſt all probable means, till they come to him, and be left on him, and then he will cure what is otherwayes incurable, and for which there is no balme beſide. 8. It is the duty of ſuch as minde to ſet about repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion to God in earneſt, to do it with encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and hope; and as we are to believe that the Lord not onely ſends cleanly trials that he may get work, and give proofes of his art; but even corrections for ſin, as minding our good, and that he may draw us to repentance; and alloweth us to take even a ſtroak inflicted in wrath, as an errand to come to him with, and ſent to drive us to his mercy, when we want an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other argument: So we ought to encourage our ſelves, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting that God, who mindes our good in affliction, will give a good iſſue to it, when we are made to feele it, and driven to him by it; for, thus do they proceed, <hi>Let us return, for he hath torn,</hi> and by ſo doing invites us to returne, <hi>and he will heal;</hi> and ſo our indeavours will not be in vain. Where men have not theſe right conſtructions of God, and this hope in ſome meaſure, their convictions will but drive them further away, and their diſcouraging exerciſe will but impede their repentance; whereas apprehenſion of mercy under the ſenſe of anger, will draw the heart to turn to God. See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.2. 9. All the afflictions and diſeaſes of a penitent will in due time end in through healing, and in the meane time the Lord will handle him tenderly and to his profit: He will be a tender Chirurgion to give him a roome in his heart and ſympathy, and will not launce his wounds, but when it is in order to his cure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and when he hath balme and oyle to poure into them; for, all this do they expect; <hi>He hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and he will binde us up.</hi>

                     <p>This <hi>ver.</hi> (containing the ſecond ground of their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is by many applied to the reſurrection of Chriſt on the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114928:61"/>
third day, (which will be acknowledged by <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the time of their converſion) as if it were the Scripture the Apoſtle points at, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.4. And thus the ſenſe is, that the penitents fetch the ground of their hope of recovery from the reſurrection of Chriſt, in whom and through whom it is that his people do live and recover out of their miſeries and troubles. And indeed this interpretation hath theſe truths in it, 1. That Chriſt and promiſes concerning him, is the uſuall and ordinary ground of the Churches comfort in troublous times, as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. 2. Penitents apprehending Chriſt by faith, in his ſufferings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, will finde ample ground of comfort in all their troubles; for, 1. Through him the ſting is taken out of all their trouble, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56, 57. 2. As he is their head, ſo all their troubles are accounted his, not onely what is expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for his truth and cauſe, but even all of the penitents trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are his in reſpect of ſympathy. 3. They are ſweetned to the penitent, by Chriſts eſſaying their lots in his own perſon, and ſo ſanctifying them unto them. 4. As believers are made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to him in ſufferings, ſo in his deliverance he is a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of their victory, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 5. He is the purchaſer of believers deliverance, having paid a price for it. 6. His reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and victory is a pledge of their deliverance, being judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally raiſed up in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. All which ſhould invite afflicted ſinners to cloſe with Chriſt, as being a compendious way to a ſweet iſſue from all troubles.</p>
                     <p>But the drift of this context ſeemeth not to ſpeake ſo expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his reſurrection, as of the raiſing up of penitents them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which doth indeed flow from his reſurrection, and that may be hinted at here. And ſo this encouragement is an ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the former, meeting with the deadlineſſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their trouble; wherein they expect that albeit their troubles were ſo great and of ſuch continuance, as that they ſeemed to be dead and buried under them; yet the Lord, in due time, would not onely revive and raiſe them up from their graves, but make them live a comfortable life in his preſence and favour. As for the time to which this reſtitution is limited, <hi>after two dayes, in the third day,</hi> it is diverſly conceived, by ſome for a long time, that neither at preſent, nor for ſome time after, were they to meet with this mercy; others under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of a ſhort time. We may take in both in diverſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; that the time of their reſtitution after their converſion, may be ſomewhat prolonged, and ſeeme ſo to ſenſe, and yet it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114928:62"/>
may be juſtly accounted ſhort, if they reckon right. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such oft-times is the obſtinacie of the viſible Church in her ſin, and her ſtupiditie under judgements inflicted for ſin, and ſuch is the Lords ſeverity in proſecuting a begun controverſie, That ſhe may not onely be ſmitten, and ſore wounded and torne, but in a manner quite dead and buried under trouble; for, ſo is here imported, ſhe needs to be <hi>revived, and raiſed up.</hi> See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 14.1.7. 2. True penitents are allowed ground of hope of recovery, were their condition never ſo deſperate and deadly; for, here they profeſſe their hope that it will be ſo. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents do but wrong God, and themſelves, when they draw hard concluſions on their lots, and do not leave a latitude to Gods love and omnipotency, and anſwer all their inextricable doubts with, <hi>O Lord, thou knoweſt. Ezek</hi> 37.3. 3. It may ſeeme good to the Lord, not to deliver penitents at their firſt ſeeking of him, but may keep them under exerciſe for a time that he may ſharpen them yet more in that duty, and try the reality thereof for, it is <hi>after two dayes,</hi> and not at firſt they expect it. 4. Albeit length of time under trouble, joyned with the greatneſſe of it, and the Lords ſeeming to neglect prayer and repentance for a time, be a ſore triall, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2. and 119 82. yet the penitent is allowed to believe, that however he delay, till it come to that complaint, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8 20. yet delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will come, and that no length of time ought to bring the truth of the Word in queſtion: for, ſo do they reckon, that though it be not till <hi>after two dayes,</hi> yet <hi>he will revive.</hi> See, <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.3. 5. How long ſoever the Lord delay, a penitent is ſtill bound to avoid fainting, and to account the time ſhort, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with eternity, and by his reſolution, patience, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the delay; for, in theſe reſpects, this form of ſpeech, <hi>after two dayes, in the third day,</hi> may import a ſhort time. 6. Albeit the Lord in delivering his people, do proceed uſually by degrees, becauſe our narrow veſſels can receive his mercies, and obſerve them but by parts; yet where he begins, he will compleat deliverance, how ſmall ſoever the beginnings be: for, here his Word is held out in ſeverall branches, of <hi>reviving</hi> in their graves, <hi>raiſing up</hi> out of their graves after they are revived, and cauſing them to <hi>live</hi> and walke after they are revived and raiſed up; and all theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, make a compleat deliverance. 7. The Lord will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in due time, recover the deſperat and hopeleſſe outward condition of his people; but will alſo refreſh and revive their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114928:62"/>
dying ſpirits thereby, which may be ſo broken, that outward deliverances will not cure them; for, ſo much may be imported in that when they are <hi>revived,</hi> and <hi>raiſed up,</hi> they <hi>ſhall live,</hi> that is, their hearts ſhall be encouraged and refreſhed thereby, and enabled to improve that mercy. 8, As much and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued trouble, may give a ſore cruſh to piety, and weaken hands in the duties thereof; So mercies and encouragements are then bleſſed, when they make men active and lively in walking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; for, ſo much alſo is imported in that, being <hi>revived</hi> and <hi>raiſed up,</hi> they <hi>ſhall live,</hi> or walke in newneſſe of life. 9. As they who would approve themſelves in duty, ought to walke ſinglie as before God; ſo his delivered people, improving their deliverances for that end, may expect to enjoy the favour and countenance of God, and to live under his protection and care; for, both theſe may be held out in this, <hi>we ſhall live in his fight:</hi> or, walk as before him, and be refreſhed in his favour and care.</p>

                     <p>In the third ground of encouragement, (which is an enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that <hi>living in his fight, ver.</hi> 2.) they promiſe unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that by repentance and turning unto God, they ſhall attain unto, and grow in the ſaving knowledge of God, which is the root of true piety, and in the experimentall knowledge of the favour and love of God in Chriſt, as the fruit and cheriſher of piety. The certainty and ſweetneſſe of this encouragement, is further confirmed and illuſtrate from two ſimilitudes, ſhewing that unto the penitent there is a time of Gods manifeſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, like the morning light that comes after the dark night, and the rain that comes after the drought: So the knowing of God is to be underſtood here, as comprehending true piety and godlineſſe, whereof this is the root.

Doct.</hi> 1. The great encouragement of a true penitent, is the hope of attaining to true piety, which is an encouragement and reward
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114928:63"/>
unto it ſelfe; and ſuch as begin a true repentance, may expect not to be diſappointed in this; for, <hi>Then</hi> (to wit, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and he hath revived) <hi>ſhall we know,</hi> to wit, <hi>the Lord,</hi> as is after expreſſed: This is their ſure hope and ſweet encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. The ſumme and root and life of true Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt: for, ſo do they comprehend it, <hi>we ſhall know the Lord.</hi> See, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. It is not onely a principall part in Religion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. but more doth flow from it; for, if God were better known in his power, fidelity, beauty, terror, and in his other attributes, and his love in Chriſt, it would produce more confidence, encouragement, obedience, fear to offend, and would allure hearts more unto him. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 51.12, 13. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Heb</hi> 12.28, 29. and elſewhere. 3. The Lord is for the moſt part an unknown, or miſtaken God in the world, by reaſon of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall darkneſſe, the diſtance bred by deſertion, the power of tentation, our looking through the proſpect of our own guilt, and the want of ſenſible need of what is in him; for, here it is held out as a ſpeciall priviledge of penitents, <hi>We ſhall know the Lord.</hi> 4, The true penitent purſuing after piety, ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain thereunto, but ſhall experimentally taſte of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and goodneſſe of God, to encourage him in his courſe; He ſhall experimentally know how good God is, and that it is not in vain to ſeek him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.19. He ſhall know his fidelity in keeping Covenant, notwithſtanding ſad diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; He ſhall be confirmed that his wiſdome and power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rules all diſpenſations for his good, and that he hath thoughts of peace toward him, in times of ſaddeſt trouble; So much alſo doth this import, <hi>we ſhall know the Lord.</hi> 5. Piety and the knowledge of God, and the experimentall manifeſtations of him, is an infinite and growing ſubject, which cannot be all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up at firſt; Every ſtep of our way may diſcover more of our ſhort-coming and ignorance to us, and when we have taſted moſt of his bounty, there is ſtill more to be communicate; for, when men know, there is need to <hi>follow on to know the Lord.</hi> See, <hi>Job.</hi> 42.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2, 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. 6. As true and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified knowledge of God will be growing, and make men deſire more of it, both for ſecuring their own good condition to them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.31, 32. and that they may taſt more of the ſweetneſſe of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. So ſuch as thus preſſe on to know God, do prove that indeed they do know him, how little ſoever they ſeeme to have: For; it is added, <hi>We ſhall follow on to know the Lord,</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:114928:63"/>
both as an effect, and evidence of their knowing of him. 7. When penitents have done all they can by way of duty, yet their living, their knowing and enjoying of God, muſt flow from his gracious and active manifeſtation of himſelfe, without which all their endeavoures would be uſeleſſe; for ſo much is held forth in the confirmation, it is <hi>his going forth,</hi> (or manifeſtation of himſelfe, oppoſite to his going away, Chap. 5.15.) and his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us,</hi> that is the cauſe of all this. 8. The manifeſtations of God toward his penitent people, are certain and in readineſſe as being decreed of old; for, <hi>his going forth is prepared,</hi> and ready. See, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Pſal</hi> 31.19. 9. This ſimilitude taken from the morning doth teach, 1. That refreſhment and deliverance is as certain unto penitents, after their trouble, as it is certain in the courſe of nature, that the morning followeth the night. Hence it is, that theſe viciſſitudes in the courſe of nature are brought in the Churches plea for the change of her ſad condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.16, 17. 2. That the Lords manifeſtation of himſelfe to his people, will be as refreſhfull after their trouble, as the cleare morning is after the dark night, eſpecially to a wearied Centinell, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 10. The ſecond ſimilitude from <hi>rain, &amp;c. Teacheth.</hi> 1. The preſence of God to his people parched with trouble and tentation will be as refreſhfull, as the rain can be to burnt up ground. See, <hi>Jer</hi> 31.12. 2. Gods refreſhing of his people will produce fruitfullneſſe alſo, and cheare up their decayed, diſcouraged and blaſted graces, as the rain doth the fruits of the ground. 3. The manifeſtations of God to his people, will be ſeaſonable, when they are moſt needed, and may be moſt uſefull; for, ſo is <hi>the former and latter rain,</hi> diſpenſed on the earth. See, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. 4. His manifeſtations will alſo be conſtant to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to begin and carry them on to perfection; for, in this alſo doth the reſemblance hold in <hi>the former and latter rain.</hi> 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord ſee it fit oft-times to delay and ſuſpend the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of himſelfe, yet it is his peoples duty not to weary; but they ought to teſtifie their eſtimation thereof, by their eagerneſs and unwearied patience in expecting it; for, to this end alſo is this ſimilitude made uſe of in Scripture; That as men wait for this rain with great earneſtneſſe, as being of ſingular uſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 29.23. and as the husband-man patiently waits for it, that he may at laſt have a fruitfull harveſt to recompence his labours: So ſhould the Lords people earneſtly and yet patiently wait for him, as knowing that his coming will make up all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>

                     <p>Followeth the ſecond part of the Chap. wherein, after this ſweet digreſſion, foretelling their future repentance, the Lord returnes to his former challenges againſt theſe two Kingdomes and clears himſelfe that he was not the cauſe of that deſtruction that was to come upon them before theſe joyfull dayes. So that this purpoſe doth not come in by way of exception againſt their repentance, formerly deſcribed as unſound; for that contains a patterne of true Repentance, and of what they will do at their laſt converſion. But the dependance may be conceived thus; That on the one hand, the Lord having comforted the truly godly by this prediction, he now turns himſelfe to the body of the people, and his affection (if we may ſpeak of him after the manner of man) being kindled with the thoughts of that ſweet time of love that was to be betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and him, he expoſtulates with them that they were nothing like this pattern here preſcribed, and that themſelves being Judges, he could do no other then deſtroy them. On the other hand, whereas they might object, how could he deſtroy them toward whom he had ſuch a purpoſe, and they were ſtill ready to accuſe his rigour and ſeverity toward them: Therefore he puts them to inſtruct any cauſe they could, wherefore he ſhould deal otherwiſe with them.</p>
                     <p>We may take up the purpoſe in theſe, 1. An aſſertion that he was not to blame for their deſtruction, but their own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was ſo deplorably deſperate, that he propounds the matter to themſelves, to ſhew upon what grounds he could do otherwiſe with them then he did, conſidering their way. 2. Some confirmations of this aſſertion, whereof the firſt (in the reſt of this <hi>v.</hi>) prevents an objection taken from their ſeeming good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at ſome times, as we finde ſeverall reformations in <hi>Judah,</hi> and in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> we have <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation, <hi>Jehu</hi>'s zeale, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their Kings not ſo bad as the reſt of them, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.2. Concerning this the Lord declareth, that (whatever reall good was in ſome perſons, yet) any work of repentance or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the body of the people attained to, was empty and in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114928:64"/>
conſtant, and could no more endure, nor abide the touch-ſtone then the morning-cloud and dew can endure the riſing Sun. And therefore this could not hinder, but rather haſten their deſtruction. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord proceeds in ſeverity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, he is not to be looked on as one who takes pleaſure in ſuch a way, or who delighted in it, if their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did not unavoidably call for it; for, ſo much doth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation (wherein he puts on the affections of a perplexed creature) teach us. See, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.8. 2. The diſpoſition and way of the viſible Church is oft-times ſo deſperate, that no diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation will better them; and however the Lord take no pleaſure in their deſtruction, and their priviledges ſeeme to call for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lot; yet there is no remedy, but their carriage draweth it on; For, <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? &amp;c.</hi> imports that he had eſſayed all other means, but in vain, and that now he could do no otherwiſe with them. See, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.16, 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Ezek</hi> 5.13. with. 6.9. and. 24.13. 3. The conſciences of the Lords people may plead for God, proceeding in greateſt ſeverity, if they were awaked; and it is their duty to juſtifie him in judging; and for this end to be ſenſible of their deſperate incorrigibleneſſe; for, this queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do unto thee?</hi> doth not import any ignorance and perplexity in God, but puts the matter to their own conſciences, which being well informed (as they ought to be) would juſtifie him in his greateſt ſeverity. 4. As oft-times a people enjoying purer worſhip, may be as ripe for judgement, and in as deſperate a condition as they who have made fouler viſible defection; ſo the univerſall overſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſin contributes to make a peoples caſe more irremediable; Therefore is <hi>Judah</hi> put to it with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who yet ſeemed to be far better then they; and this is an evidence of their deſperate caſe. 5. A people may have ſome ſhew of goodneſſe, at leaſt at ſome times, who yet are little the better, and their condition nothing the leſſe deſperate; for, ſo it is ſuppoſed this people had, <hi>your goodneſſe,</hi> which comprehends any ſhew of piety toward God, or of goodneſſe, bounty and mercy toward men, which they had at any time. 6. Mens goodneſſe, when it is onely in ſhew, and not in reality, proves ordinarily a great ſnare and neck-break to them, as hiding the ſight of their deſerving from them, being a ground of exceptation againſt challenges, and of ſwelling againſt corrections; Therefore muſt the Lord here take off this objection, and clear what their goodneſſe was. 7. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever goodneſſe men ſeeme to have, yet it will not availe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114928:65"/>
them, when either it is but empty, and wants a firme root, or proclaimes its own unſoundneſſe by its inconſtancy, and being but at fits; for, ſo much doth this compariſon teach us, <hi>Your goodneſſe is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</hi> Whatever uſe may be made of theſe ſimilitudes elſewhere, to point out what is really good, yet in this place they point at the emptineſſe of their goodneſſe (as a cloud that hath no rain in it, and the dew that enters not into the ground, to moiſten it) and at its inconſtancy, and evaniſhing.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond confirmation of their deſperate condition, is, that the Word did no good unto them. Albeit the Lord by his Word dealt effectually and ſharply with them, as men do with rough ſtones and knotted timber, to ſquare them, yet all this did but ſlay them, <hi>v.</hi> 5 — And albeit their duty was held clearly out in the Word, as the light of the morning, <hi>v.</hi>—5. And particularly they were informed that God was not pleaſed they ſhould reſt on their ceremoniall performances, which ought onely to have the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, neglecting morall duties of the firſt and ſecond Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſhould be their chiefe work, <hi>v.</hi> 6. yet they made ill uſe of all this cleare light. And whereas God had not onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned their duty clearly, but entered in a Covenant with them, that they ſeeing and embracing the Meſſiah, who was pointed at in theſe ſacrifices, might worſhip him in faith and love, (as is enjoyned, <hi>v</hi> 6. They on the contrary brake the Covenant, and dealt treacherouſly in it, while they obtruded Ceremonies and ſacrifices upon him for expiation of ſin, and ſo turned it in a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes, and even in theſe neglected the morall and ſubſtantiall duties, <hi>v</hi> 7. <hi>Doct</hi> 1. Such as are not wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and bettered by the Word, are in an hopeleſſe condition, and not to be wrought upon by any other thing; for, this is a proofe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114928:65"/>
of their deſperate condition. See, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.29, 30, 31. 2. As it is the Lords mercy that he yet continueth his Meſſengers with his ſinful people, who provoke him, if ſo be they may yet be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo it is their duty to take up what they ſpeak either by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelation, or according to the Word, as ſpoken by God, and not to ſleight their Meſſage, nor contradict their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in carrying of it; for it is a witneſſe for God againſt them, that they had <hi>the Prophets,</hi> and they carried the words of my mouth, ſaith the Lord. See, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12, 13. 3. As all men by nature are unfit for any good, as rough ſtones and knotty timber for a building, till the Word worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and be effectuall in its reproofs and directions; So a deſperately incorrigible people, or a people inconſtant in any good, do provoke God to deale more ſharply with them by his Word; and ſuch are not to be ſoothed up by Miniſters, and this is a part of Gods care of them: for, upon what is laid to their charge, <hi>v.</hi> 4. it followeth by way of concluſion, <hi>Therefore have I hewed them by the Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> See, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.12, 13. 4. As the Word of the Lord is of ſuch efficacy, that it will either cure and rectifie a people, or elſe undo them; So this ordinary reſult in the moſt part, that the ſharp reproofes and directions of the Word, do but make them worſe, and tend at laſt to their ruin; Therefore it is ſubjoyned to his <hi>hewing, I have ſlain them by the words of my mouth,</hi> which is not to be underſtood onely of the ſharp edge of the convictions of the Word which did ſo cut upon them, as they thought themſelves ſlain by it; nor yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the finall event of this preaching, that many were cut off according to the certain threatenings of the Word, as, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.10. But of ſome neerer accidentall effect tending to that; to wit, that all his ſharp reproofes and great pains, did but make them worſe, and put out what life or activity they ſeemed yet to have in any good. Hence it is elſewhere ſaid, that the Word doth but harden, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. doth make men worſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.2. and exaſperate them the more it is inculcate, <hi>Mar.</hi> 7.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.54: <hi>Amos</hi> 7.10. 5. The Lord hath ſo clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his will concerning mens duty, as may juſtifie him, and make ſinners inexcuſable whatever they do pretend; For, it is another argument againſt them, <hi>thy judgements</hi> (or, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ordinances, wherein thou art commanded to walk) <hi>are as the light that goeth forth;</hi> that is, as cleare as day-light, which breaks out in the morning. It may be he alludes to the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry houre, wherein the Prophets were ſent out, to hold forth this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114928:66"/>
light, which ſeemeth to have been in the morning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.13. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.5. 6. Such as yield ſyncere and Evangelicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what the Lord requireth, may expect that it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and themſelves in doing of it, with pleaſure and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence; For, <hi>I deſired mercy, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he, not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, but deſired it, as a thing wherein I take pleaſure, as the word ſignifieth. 7. The rule of true Religion requireth, that as all that God commandeth ſhould be reſpected, and obedience endeavoured, So that morall and moſt ſubſtantiall duties (as a fruit of faith in Chriſt) be chiefly made conſcience of; which as they ought to take place of ceremoniall obſervances; So without them, the other are of no account in Gods ſight; For, this was the ſubject matter of the doctrine, which was ſo clearly preſſed, (and therefore comes in with a <hi>for,</hi> as an illuſtration of that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 5.) <hi>I deſired, mercy and not ſacrifice, and the knowledge of God more then burnt-offerings:</hi> Where, under <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> and <hi>burnt-offrings,</hi> is comprehended all their ceremonial performances, and ſpoken of not as they related to Chriſt the ſubſtance of all of them, but as they were externall performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces reſted on by that people. In which reſpect, his <hi>not deſiring ſacrifice,</hi> is not to be underſtood ſimply, as if the Lord did not approve, even of the externall performances, which were enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelfe; but comparatively, that he deſired morall duties <hi>more then burnt-offerings,</hi> as it is in the next ſentence. To which may be added, that in ſome caſes, when morall duties come in competition with ceremonials, the Lord doth not deſire cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials at that time, but moral duties even of the ſecond Table take place of them, or other poſitive commands concerning the externals of Religion: As, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. and 12.2,— 7. Yea further, let men ſubmit never ſo much to the externall injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about worſhip, or think to ſatisfie their own conſciences therewith, yet where Chriſt is not cloſed with to enable and make men willing and active in morall duties, they will not be approven in the other at all. As, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11,— 13. and 66. 3. See, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. 8. Such as would approve themſelves to God, ought to make conſcience of morall duties both of the firſt and ſecond Table of the Law; and particularly, the ſaving knowledge of God, whereby we may regulate the reſt of our obedience, and ſhewing of mercy in caſes wherein we ſeeme not to be ſo ſtrictly bound, will prove our reality in Religion; Therefore he puts in both <hi>the knowledge of God,</hi> of which before, and, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1, 2. and <hi>mercy,</hi> of which, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.27. Though Chriſt indeed
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114928:66"/>
extend it, as comprehending mercy toward our ſelves, as the rule of our duty toward our neighbours, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.1, 2, 7. And mercy toward the ſoules of loſt ſinners, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. 9. As it is of the Lords great mercy and condeſcendence, that he will not onely enjoyne ſinners their duty, but enter in tearmes of a Covenant with them; So he is a faithfull Covenant-keeper, on whoſe part no breach will be found; for, here all this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is held out <hi>in the Covenant,</hi> as it is before explained, wherein they onely, and not he, are tranſgreſſours. 10. As nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther clear light, nor Covenant-offers or obligations will tie ſinners to their duty; So it is a great ſin, and a perfidious and treacherous prevarication, for men to violate Covenant with God; For, <hi>they have tranſgreſſed</hi> even <hi>the Covenant there</hi> (to wit, in the Covenant) <hi>have they dealt treacherouſly againſt me.</hi> 11. Men may ſeeme to do many things in Religion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worſhip, and yet be but Covenant-breakers, when nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are led to Chriſt in and by externall performances, nor do they ſeek after what is moſt ſubſtantiall; for, albeit they omitted not <hi>ſacrifices and burnt-offerings,</hi> wherein Chriſt was held forth, yet <hi>they have tranſgreſſed the Covenant,</hi> becauſe they looked not to Chriſt in theſe, nor proved their communion with him, by a conſciencious care of performing morall duties; as is before cleared. 12. Their breaking of the Covenant, <hi>like men,</hi> is not to be underſtood ſo much of their reſembling <hi>Adam</hi> in his violating of the Covenant of works, and ſo proving themſelves children of ſuch a father: But it contains theſe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of their fault. 1. That (as the words may alſo read) they had broken the Covenant, as if it had been but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>of a man,</hi> and he their fellow-creature; Covenant-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do bewray the mean thoughts they have of God, which he will reſent and avenge. 2. Albeit he had choſen them to be his peculiar people, yet they broke the Covenant as if no ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement had been given, or obligation laid upon them, more then any men in the world. When ſingular priviledges do not tie men to duty, they will aggravate the violation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. 3. As he proved himſelfe to be God in his keeping Covenant on his part, ſo they proved themſelves to be corrupt and weak men (whoſe nature is facil and inconſtant in good) in breaking of it on their part: When we ſee our actuall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions rightly, we will be led up to be ſenſible alſo of our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and nature, from wich ſuch practices flow. 4.

                     <p>In the third place, whereas the former confirmations of their deſperate caſe might ſeeme to hold out but more generall chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges againſt them: Therefore he comes to a more particular demonſtration of the iniquities, that abounded in particular places, among particular ſorts of perſons, or of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whereby alſo he proves their breach of Covenant, and tranſgreſſion of morall commandments. The firſt challenge is againſt <hi>Gilead,</hi> whom he accuſeth to be given up to a trade of ſin, and particularly, that they were polluted with blood, or cunning in circumventing men, to ſhed their blood craftily, or (as the word may alſo bear) ſo bloody, as if their footſteps might be traced, by the blood dropping from them, which they had ſhed. By <hi>Gilead</hi> here we may underſtand that land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Jordan,</hi> given to the two tribes and halfe tribe, <hi>Num.</hi> 32. the inhabitants whereof were combined as one incorporation in theſe wicked courſes, or every city there was bent that way; and therefore they got the firſt ſtroak by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> 2 <hi>King</hi> 15.29. But it ſeems rather to be underſtood of <hi>Ramoth</hi> in <hi>Gilead,</hi> which was a city of the Prieſts, and appointed to be a refuge for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayer, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 21.38. And ſo it is to be taken as comprehending all the reſt of that kinde in theſe bounds (which it ſeems <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> and his ſucceſſors had ſtill continued for that uſe for which they were at firſt appointed,) And the ſumme of the challenge is, that they who by reaſon of the Prieſts dwelling there, and that they might be exemplary to ſuch as fled thither for refuge, ought to have been holy, were devoted to iniquity, and that they whoſe city was appointed to prevent the ſhedding of innocent blood, were polluted with blood, either by committing mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers among themſelves, or by the Prieſts their receiving in of wilfull murtherers, or ſecluding or delivering up theſe who ought
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114928:67"/>
to have been protected, if they might have any gain thereby. This interpretation is ſtrengthened and confirmed from the following <hi>verſ.</hi> Hence we may <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. In judging of the matter of Covenant-keeping, and the ſtreightneſſe of a land, the Lord hath an eſpeciall eye to perſons or places which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially obliged, and have moſt advantages to keep them right; Their miſcarriage being a ſad evidence, that the reſt of the land is not right. Therefore doth he begin the inſtancing of their deſperate condition, at <hi>Gileads</hi> wickedneſſe, where the Prieſts dwelt, and therefore ought to be an holy place. 2. As the naughtineſſe of men will ſoone corrupt the beſt of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and as no excellency and priviledge will in ſuch a caſe plead mens innocency, or allow them matter of gloriation; ſo ſuch decliners prove readily worſt of any; for, <hi>Gilead,</hi> who might pretend that they were once adorned with eminent privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are now accuſed that all that was perverted, and that now the inhabitants did worke iniquities, which is not to fall in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to commit groſſeſt ſins, and make a trade of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the character of groſſely wicked men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.8. and 92 7. and elſewhere. 3. Blood-ſhed is a very heavy charge and ſad matter of challenge; for, it <hi>pollutes, they are polluted with blood.</hi> And this is ſingled out as the particular inſtance of their groſſe iniquity, and a ſin that would trace, and finde them out at laſt, See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.21. 4. Sin, and particularly bloodſhed, will be aggravated by the place, where it is committed, and by the warnings and documents men have gotten to avoid it; and when God makes inquiſition for blood, not only actors, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currers with bloody men will be found guilty however they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh it; Therefore he challengeth <hi>Gilead</hi> of blood, which ſhould have been a Sanctuary from oppreſſion, and where they might have ſeen the fruit even of caſual ſlaughter, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayers reſtraint. And he challengeth the Prieſts as acceſſory to bloodſhed, (as is before explained) though they wanted not their own cunning conveighances in it.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114928:68"/>
challenged, that they conſpire together with one conſent to commit murther, as bands of robbers uſe to do. This the Prieſts did not onely by ſlaying peoples ſoules, and foſtering them in their ſin; but rather by their joyning with bloody murtherers, in giving ſhelter to them, as is expreſſed in the former <hi>verſ.</hi> And by their ſlaying or cauſing to murther them who went up to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> to worſhip, or others alſo who were travelling about their lawfull affaires, to which aggreeth their <hi>murther in the way:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which (whatever the particular way was) the Lord pronounceth that it is committing of lewdneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Of all ſocieties of men, none are more vile then Miniſters when once they become corrupt, they will be given up to act groſſeſt evils, and be acceſſory to all the groſſe abominations in a land; for, in theſe reſpects their Prieſts are compared to <hi>troopes of robbers,</hi> and charged with <hi>murther.</hi> 2. Corrupt Miniſters al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by their being actors, or occaſions of the ſins of a land, come to have a chiefe hand in the drawing on of generall judgements; Therefore their ſins are brought in as an inſtance of the peoples deſperate condition, and a reaſon why the Lord could do no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, but deſtroy them. 3. Such as do intrude or ſuffer themſelves to be intruded on an office to which they have no calling from God, eſpecially theſe who uſurpe the office of the Miniſtery, may expect never to do good in it, but that they will be given up to ſuch courſes as will draw plagues on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the land; for, ſuch were theſe Prieſts, who are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially challenged here.

Generall concurrence in ſin, and eſpecially of corrupt Miniſters in defection, is ſo far from extenuating, that it aggreageth ſin before the Lord; for, it adds to the challenge, that they <hi>murder by conſent,</hi> or <hi>with one ſhoulder,</hi> as the word is alſo taken, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3 9. 5. It is not ſufficient ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to ſee or ſpeak of ſin, but it would be looked upon over and over again, till it be ſeen in its colours; Therefore doth the Lord give a new ſight of this ſin, ſhewing that in it, <hi>they commit lewdneſſe.</hi> 6. Sins in the viſible Church, for which God pleads with her, when they are rightly ſeen, will be found to be lewd and vile, and particularly, it is an hainous provocation, when men dare come to that height and obſtinacy, as not onely raſhly to fall in ſin, but to plot and contrive it, and perſiſt till they act and perfect it; for, <hi>they commit lewdneſſe</hi> is his verdict, and the words in the originall will read, <hi>they act,</hi> or <hi>perfect their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114928:68"/>
and plotted wickedneſſe.</hi> See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13: And for this cauſe, it may be it is that they are charged with murther, and compared with bloody robbers, becauſe they contrived what they made others to act; <hi>For</hi> (which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a reaſon of the former) <hi>they commit,</hi> (or act, or cauſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to act) <hi>projected wickedneſſe,</hi> and ſo are as deſperate as they.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, the whole Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is accuſed, that however they covered their courſe, yet God was certain of their horrible wickedneſſe, in that <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or their Rulers, brought in the Idolatry of the calves, and other defections of that nature, which being received, defended, and propagated among the people, had polluted them to that day.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lord may have much to ſay againſt corrupt teachers in a time of general defection; yet that doth not free people before the Lord, but he will ſet their wayes in order before them; For, here after his challenges againſt the Prieſts, the whole Nation alſo is accuſed. 2. However men labour to prove ſtrange pallia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſin, as if they could do it undiſcerned, and ſo make their own wit and parts a plague unto themſelves: yet let men cover their way, and dig as deep as they will, God doth ſtill ſee them impartially; For, <hi>I have ſeen,</hi> or, <hi>I ſee an horrible thing,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 3.

This ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be the ſureſt interpretation, becauſe it taketh in both; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſumme, a declaration that God would ſend them into captivity for their ſinne, which is a proof of their deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that yet he would mitigate this ſtroak by reſtoring of them, according as <hi>Judah</hi> got the peculiar promiſe, <hi>ch.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords ſmiting of his people, is ſufficient to prove them guilty, he being the Juſt and Holy One who doth it; and when he puts in his ſickle, it is a clear proof that their harveſt is ripe; For, thus doth he prove <hi>Judah</hi>

It is true indeed, the Lord may ſharply afflict his own dear children for their trial; but when after a proceſſe deduced from the Word, he proceeds either to correct his children for their miſcarriages, or to plague the wicked for their iniquity, it ſhould ſilence all their pleading of innocency, unleſſe they would reflect upon his holineſſe and juſtice. And ſuch is the caſe here with <hi>Judah,</hi> who are challenged, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and now the challenge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſtroak, 2. Captivity and ſcattering is one of
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114928:69"/>
the fruits of the Churches ſinne, which ſo long as the Lord keeps off, ſhe is bound to acknowledge that he remembers mercy in the midſt of wrath: For, this is the ſtroak which is ſuppoſed to be inflicted on <hi>Judah</hi> here. 3. In ſaddeſt judgements, the LORD intends mercie to his peculiar people, and conveighs threatening in the boſome of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to them, allowing them when they feel the one, to comfort themſelves in the hope of the other; For, this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence is only ſuppoſed in the boſome of a promiſe, <hi>I will return the captivity of my people,</hi> giving them the firſt ſight of their trouble in a promiſe of deliverance from it. 4. As ſinne doth ripen a Nation for ſtroakes, and an harveſt of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; So trouble on the Lords people, however it do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſolve in an iſſue, yet (beſides that there is a viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in all lots under the Sunne,) in due time, by the Lords bleſſing of the uſe of it to his people, and through his ſympathy remembring them in their low eſtate; it will ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, not only to a reſtitution, but an harveſt of advantage: For, it is <hi>an harveſt for Judah, when I returne the captivity of my people,</hi> an harveſt for which we are to wait patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>James</hi> 5.7. and wherein the ſower will not only get his ſeed, but increaſe with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.5, 6.</p>

                     <p>The firſt challenge is directed chiefly, (though not ſecluding others) againſt their <hi>Rulers</hi> under the name of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and againſt the chief City; wherein they are accuſed for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and incurableneſſe, in that when the Lord applied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to cure the people of their ſins and judgements, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that their ſin was incurable, as might appear from their deceit, and their violence and oppreſſion in City and Countrey: all which made it evident that there was no remedie, but they muſt be deſtroyed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As ſinne is of it ſelf the great ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and wound of a people, affecting the ſoul and conſcience, and drawing on ſad wounds of afflictions. So it is God only who can cure theſe wounds; For, <hi>I would have healed Iſrael,</hi> ſaith he, as a Phyſician offering his help. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 60.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.14. 2. As the Lord only can cure his people, ſo he is willing to offer his help, and eſſay means for that end, before he give up with them; For, <hi>I would have healed Iſrael.</hi> This the Lord did, and in all ages doth to his people, ſometime by his Word ſent out to reclaime them from ſin, as there were many Prophets raiſed up in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.15, 16. ſometime by giving breathings of proſperity, (as under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Joaſh,</hi> and others,) to ſee if that would draw them to ceaſe from their courſe of ſin; ſometime by ſending leſſer afflictions, (whereof <hi>Iſrael</hi> had many eſſayes) as medecine to purge out ſin, and prevent more ſad fruits thereof. See <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 27.9. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. and ſometime by cutting off eminent
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114928:71"/>
ring-leaders in Apoſtaſie, and giving opportunities of a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, if ſo be that might work on them. As when he cut off <hi>Ahabs</hi> houſe, and raiſed up <hi>Jehu,</hi> who pretended zeale for the Lord. In applying theſe means of cure, the Lord doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes work according to his Omnipotency, but offereth only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient external means; yet mercy would be ſeen in the Method, and ſuch lots would be improved as medicinal. 3. When God applies means of healing, it is uſual for men to prove worſe, and to make it evident that they are incorrigible; The Word may but irritate corruption, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. an opportunity of Reformation may diſcover heart-enmity againſt the wayes of God; mercy and reſpite may embolden to ſin, and rods make men worſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. For, <hi>When I would have healed Iſrael, then the iniquity of Ephraim was diſcovered, and the wickedneſſe of Samaria,</hi> as a Phyſician by attempting a cure, may finde it worſe then at firſt it appeared, and the diſeaſe may break out worſe: So did it fare with them, the means applied did not only diſcover, but was an occaſion of their incorrigible temper. He calleth their courſe <hi>iniquity,</hi> and <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> or many <hi>evils,</hi> becauſe they brake out in more and more groſſe ills, or becauſe leſſer ills after ſuch means, are indeed worſe then greater ills were before. 4. Rulers and theſe that are in eminent places, do ordinarily prove moſt incorrigible in their evils, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful under means of healing, and great obſtructers of a Lands happineſſe; For, ſaith the Lord, <hi>When I would have healed Iſrael,</hi> it was <hi>Ephraims</hi> and <hi>Samarias</hi> ſins that brake out and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it. 5. Deceit and falſhood in mens dealings, is a ſad evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an incorrigible time, as teſtifying how little place the feare of God hath among men; Therefore it comes in as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation that they would not be healed; <hi>for they commit falſhood.</hi> See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.1, 5, 6. 6. It is alſo an evidence of ſuch a ſad time, when injuſtice and oppreſſion prevaile, and men are ſtill ſo in love with the world, that all injuſt courſes, ſecret or open, are followed, that they may compaſſe it; For, it is another proof, <hi>and the thief cometh in,</hi> privately into the houſe or City, <hi>and the troop of robbers ſpoileth without,</hi> that is, no place in City or Countrey, in the houſe or fields, is free of ſecret ſtealth, or open robbery.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond ſin for which they are challenged, (and which, as all the reſt, are ſo many proofes of their incurableneſſe, which he had laid to their charge, <hi>v.</hi> 1.) is, their prophane ſecurity and ſtupid atheiſme, in that they did no more think of giving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their wayes, then if there were not a God, or they had never heard of him. Becauſe of which the Lord declareth, that as he is a Judge who ſeeth all their wayes; ſo they ſhould ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finde themſelves ſo involved in the fruits of their own ſins, as if they were in a net, and ſhould not flee his judgements. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is mens dutie to be much with their own heart, in conſidering their caſe, and how it is with them; For, it is a challenge, <hi>they conſider not in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> or, <hi>ſay not to their hearts,</hi> that is, they put not their own hearts to it, to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how matters ſtand with them. 2. It ought eſpecially to be conſidered by men in examining their own condition, that ſin unrepented of is remembred by God, how long ſoever it be ſince it was committed; For, it is ſpecially laid to their charge, that they conſider not <hi>that I remember all their wickedneſſe,</hi> but ſince they were ſpared, and proſpered after their ſinning, they thought God took no notice, or had forgotten all; whereas he was but putting it up upon their account. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.34, 35. 3. When men give over conſideration of their caſe, they turne in effect Atheiſts, denying unto God a providence, and by this they are more and more emboldened to ſin; For, not to conſider <hi>that God remembers all their wickedneſſe,</hi> is in effect to deny a God, to deny that ever he will puniſh ſin, and conſequently, that he knoweth or taketh notice of it, or hath power to redreſſe it. And this is laid to their charge as an evil which looſed the raines in them to all ſin; For, then they had <hi>all wickedneſſe.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 94.3,—7. 4. As God knoweth and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth all the wayes of the children of men, whatever they imagin to the contrary; So he will bring Atheiſts to know ſo much, by giving them the fruit of their own wayes; For, <hi>their own doings

have beſet them about,</hi> (that is, their guilt in the effects thereof, ſhall lay hold on them on every hand, that they may not eſcape;) <hi>they are before my face.</hi> This he ſubjoynes to the former, though they were before him, before they beſet them, becauſe they ſhall be made to know they were obſerved by God, when they ſhall beſet them. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21, 22. 5. When men, eſpecially within the viſible Church, turn practical Atheiſts, and by forgetting and denying of God, take courage in ſin, it is a token that God will very ſpeedily refute that errour, by taking order with them for their ſins; For, ſaith he, <hi>Now,</hi> that is, ſhortly, <hi>their own doings have beſet them,</hi> where he ſpeaks of it in the by-paſt-time, becauſe of its certainty and celerity. 6. Man needs no ſurer fetters and ties to bring him to judgement, then his own guilt, which will ſurround him, ſometime in his own conſcience, and alwayes purſue him in effects, till it leave him in the hands of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; For, <hi>their own doings have beſet them about.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 32.23.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The third ſin challenged, is, that the people did pleaſe their King and Rulers with <hi>their wickedneſſe,</hi> (that is, they gave obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them in their wicked commands, eſpecially concerning Religion, <hi>ch.</hi> 5.11. which they expected would not have been taken ſo well by the people; and they ſtudied to make them more and more glad by their wicked behaviour, ſince they ſaw them ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with it.) And with their <hi>lies,</hi> whereby we may underſtand their falſe worſhip, which is a lying and a deceiving courſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20. and a lewd lie, to father it on God, as true worſhip per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to him, as, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. Or, we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of their malicious ſlandering of ſuch as were oppoſite to the courſe of the Court, and of the times; or of their flattering their Rulers, to comfort them when their conſciences vexed them; or generally that they gave them occaſion of joy that was deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Let men rejoyce or glory never ſo much in ſin, yet wickedneſſe is but a poor ſport, and will prove ſo in end; For, it draweth God to be againſt them, that they were <hi>made glad with wickedneſſe.</hi> 2. It evidenceth the ſad caſe of a Land, when they who ſhould advance piety and vertue, and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114928:72"/>
puniſh vice, are on the contrary rejoycers at the wickedneſſe of their people, and glad to get them drawen to it: For, it is the challenge, that <hi>the King and Princes are made glad with their</hi> (that is, the peoples) <hi>wickedneſſe,</hi> that they have a people who will obey their wicked commands, and are not ſo tender and ſcrupulous, as to make queſtion of right and wrong, eſpecially in the matter of Religion, but will run whither they are driven by a ſupreme command. 3. It is alſo a ſad caſe when men, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially great ones, have ſuch deſignes, as cannot be compaſſed but by wickedneſſe; and when they are ſo far given up, as to be glad to attain their end, by whatſoever means it be; For, ſo much alſo doth the challenge import; Their Rulers could not carry their buſineſſe, unleſſe their ſubjects were embarqued in a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed courſe; and they were ſo farre from making ſcruple of that, that they were glad the people were ſo, that they might gain their point. 4. It is the uſuall diſpoſition and woful ſin of a people, that they are ſtill upon the prevailing ſide, and do follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and will of their Rulers, if it were even to ſin; For, it is laid to their charge, <hi>They make the King glad with their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c.</hi> they will make no bones of ſin, if they know it may pleaſe him; yea, they will prove more plyable and forward, then could have been expected of them. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.12. 5. As I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and falſe worſhip is a deceitful ground of comfort, and will not be owned by God, whatever men pretend; and as the calumniating of upright men is an uſual way of promoting a falſe Religion; So a deceitful lying comfort is a dangerous ſnare, and it is the great ſin of any to be inſtrumental in applying of it; For, ſo much is imported in that part of the challenge, <hi>They make the King and Princes</hi> (for both are underſtood in every one of the branches,) <hi>glad with their lies.</hi>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The fourth ſin challenged, is, their proneneſſe to adultery, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or ſpiritual, or both, of which they were generally guilty. This is illuſtrate from the ſimilitude of a Baker heating an Oven, and kneading Dough; who ceaſeth to raiſe himſelf or others to put in the Bread, till it be leavened, and the Oven hot. In ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114928:73"/>
wherof, we need not reſtrict it particularly to this, that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and his faction were hot upon the Idolatry of the calves, of which he was the contriver and Baker, but yet did ceaſe to put it in practcie, till by emiſſaries the people were leavened and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Nor yet to this, that they were mad upon ſin, and yet inſenſible and careleſſe of their caſe becauſe of it, as a ſleeping Baker. But it ſeemes rather to hold out this general, That they opened their hearts ſo to Satans fiery tentations, as an Oven is to fire, and were ſo inflamed and fitted thereby, as preſently on an occaſion they acted the ſins, as an hot Oven will bake the Bread when once it is leavened, and put into it; and as an Oven continues heating, till the Dough be leavened and ready to be put into it; ſo their heat of luſt and tentation, was not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed till it was ſatisfied; And further as an Oven into which fire and fuel is put, keeps the heat, and leaven goeth through the lump, though none watch about them, but the Baker and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſleep; ſo their hearts being once peſtered with ſin, did feed themſelves therein. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A viſible Church not receiving the love of the truth, is juſtly given over to vile uncleanneſſe, both in worſhip and manners, and to be monſtrouſly enflamed thereunto, by Satan and his fire-brands; For, ſuch was <hi>Iſraels</hi> condition, <hi>They are adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker,</hi> where the Baker may caſt in what fire and fuel he will, and where the heat is moſt violent, as being kept in compact together. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. 2. The more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſin be, it doth adde to the Lords controverſie againſt a Land; For, <hi>They are all adulterers,</hi> that is, they are generally guilty, though not every one, and this is a part of the challenge. 3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may pretend without themſelves, as an excuſe for their corrupting their wayes; yet upon true triall, they will finde it to flow from their own hearts polluted by Satan; nor will it ſuffice to acknowledge ſome infirmity and inadvertencie in their ſin, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they ſee it deeper rooted in their hearts; For, whereas they might pretend they followed theſe courſes only to pleaſe their Kings,, and obey their commands, the Lord lets them ſee it was their own hearts enflamed with luſts, and Satans tentations, like <hi>an oven heated,</hi> that drew them to it, and that this was no ſudden fit, but the fruit of deeply corrupted hearts, as an Oven that hath been long heated with much fuel. 4. Albeit that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men do not alwayes break forth in actuall wickedneſſe, yet are they not the more innocent for that; For, 1. Their ſpirits are peſtered and haunted with ſin, though they do not act it, as the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114928:73"/>
Oven is ſtill heating, and the Dough ſtill leavening, though the Baker and others ſleep. 2. It is not of them that they do not act ſin, it is only through the want of a tentation and occaſion; as the hot Oven ceaſeth from baking Bread, and the Baker from putting it in, only till it be leavened and ready. 3. Their heat of luſt is never extinct, nor do they labour to mortifie it, but it continueth reſtleſſe and furious till it be ſatisfied; as the Oven ſtill heats and burneth, till the Bread be leavened and put in. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. Albeit good motions, when they are moſt fervent, need frequent cheriſhing, as being no native plant of our hearts; yet when evil once gets footing, it will entertain and feed it ſelf, and grow upon our hand; For, the Oven will heat, and the Dough leaven, though all ſhould ſleep after they have put in the fire and the leaven.</p>

                     <p>The fifth accuſation is for Court-intemperance, in King, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Courtiers, without any reſpect to honeſty or ſhame. In ſo much that on the Kings birth-day, or the day of his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ſome other ſolemnity, yearly obſerved by him, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did draw the King to be drunk; whereby, 1. He contracted ſickneſſe. 2. It made him forget and proſtitute his place and authority, joyning in ſociety with ſcorners, or men eminently diſſolute, and look rather like ſuch in his drunkenneſſe, then like a King. <hi>Doct,</hi> 1. Dayes which men will have obſerved as dayes of feſtivity and ſolemnity, do ordinarily prove dayes of great miſcarriage and provocation againſt God: For, it is <hi>in the day of our King,</hi> that they contract very eminent guilt; In the Original it is, <hi>the day of our Kings,</hi> wherein the Lord by his Prophet repeats their words, as proclaiming and boaſting of it, and therefore looſing the rains to intemperance. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Job.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.2, 3. 2. Drunkenneſſe and ſenſuality is an hainous crying ſin, and particularly in Rulers; For, it is a ſad challenge, that they ſhould be given to <hi>bottels of wine.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16, 17. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. 3.

to Kings, who having their ear and countenance, do make uſe of it for no other end, but to draw them to ſin againſt God; For, it is <hi>the Princes who have made him ſick, &amp;c.</hi> 4. It is the height of ſenſuality, when men not only become brutiſh themſelves, but dare invite and tempt others to the ſame exceſſe of riot, and by all meanes draw them to drunkenneſſe: For, it is the ſin of the Princes, that they draw the King to drink. See <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1.8. 5. Men by their intemperance, do not only draw on the guilt of miſſpending time, and abuſing the good creatures of God; but of ſelf-murther, and abuſing their own bodies alſo: For, they <hi>make him ſick with bottles of wine,</hi> either by making him drink whole bottles, or drinke wine, which in theſe parts they kept and carried in bottels. 6. Dayes of feaſting and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, do alſo ordinarily prove dayes of great inſolence and boldneſſe in all other ſins: When mens hearts are up with carnal pleaſures and joy, and benummed with ſenſuality, they care not what they do, they ſtand in aw of none, and they will ſcorne all that contradict them, or are not of their minde and way; For, it is imported here, there are <hi>ſcorners</hi> in the day of their King, that is, either mockers of all ſuch as applaud not their way, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.16. or ſuch as are come to an height of impiety, to ſcorne and defie God and his threatenings, and therefore are called <hi>the ſcornful, Pſal.</hi> 1.1. 7. It is alſo the great ſin of drunkards, that by their ſenſuality, they deprive themſelves of the uſe of reaſon, and render themſelves contemptible and like beaſts, that they can neither know their place nor dutie; For, the King in his drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſſe <hi>ſtretched out his hand with ſcorners,</hi> that is, debaſed himſelf to keep ſociety with ſuch lewd perſons, and looked liker one of theſe then a King. 8 It is the ſin of Kings and Rulers, or any in lawful power, to proſtitute that authority wherewith God hath ſtamped them in their office, and to render it contemptible by their own miſcarriage, by countenancing inſolent ſinners, whom they ſhould ſuppreſſe; and by converſing with baſe and vile perſons, and joyning with them in baſe courſes unbeſeeming their ſtation and dignitie; For, herein did their King ſin, in <hi>ſtretching out his hand with ſcorners.</hi>

Profane and corrupt men, their fawning upon, or ſeeming to comply with the humors of theſe in authority, even in every thing, and without any reſpect to the commands of God, is yet no aſſurance, but they may, when they have opportunity, turn diſloyal: And they may take as little notice of Gods Law ſubjecting them to the higher powers, as they did of his other commands, in their ſinful compliances with Rulers humours; For, <hi>they who make the King glad with their wickedneſſe, v.</hi> 3. and who obſerved their Birth or Coronation-dayes with much riot &amp; ſenſuality, <hi>v.</hi> 5. now, <hi>they have devoured their Judges, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Theſe violent luſts and turbulent effects of them, are the fruit of not calling on God, who being ſought unto, would ſubdue theſe luſts, and correct theſe evils, which luſt leads men to apply vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedies unto. When God giveth up a people to ſuch courſes of ſedition and conſpiracy, it is a token that neither the Land, which is in ſuch a diſtemper, nor the actors in theſe courſes are given to prayer, at leaſt in a right and ſincere way; For, where theſe courſes are, it may be ſaid, <hi>there is none among them that calleth unto me,</hi> or, generally they neglect it. 5. It is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of great ſtupidity, and the cauſe of a controverſie from the Lord, when greateſt commotions, alterations and confuſions
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114928:75"/>
will not make a people ſenſible, nor ſtir them up to look to God and call on him: For, the words may import alſo this challenge that all theſe overturnings of the ſtate did nothing at them, the people never thought on turning to God, or employing of him, <hi>there is none among them that calleth unto me.</hi>

                     <p>The ſeventh ſin for which they are challenged, is their mixture with the Heathen Nations, (carried on eſpecially by <hi>Ephraim</hi> or their Rulers,) whereby they became <hi>a cake not turned:</hi> by which I do not underſtand ſo much a threatening, that the hungry ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (of whom, <hi>v.</hi> 9.) ſhall cat him up as a hungry man would eat a cake lying on the fire, not ſtaying till it be baked: as a declaration of the ſinful effects of this mixture, that they became (as we ſay) neither raw nor roſted, neither a people who had wholly quit God, nor who cleaved to Gods way; yea, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came hot on the Idolatrous ſide, and cold in the matter of true Religion. For clearing of this mixture, and wherein the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof conſiſted, Conſider, 1. The parties with whom they mixed, were not any profane companie, or perſons among themſelves, but <hi>the people,</hi> or Heathen Nations and Idolaters about, with whom it was not lawful for <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo much as to converſe familiarly, or to marry, (but if they had, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to divorce) far leſſe to joyne in a Congregation with them, as members of the viſible Church. 2. The mixture condemned was not ſo much local, or in place, nor only in confederacies, or marriages; But the mixture was chiefly morall, in embracing their falſe Religion, and becoming like unto them, as is cleared in the end of the Verſe. 3. This mixture and conjunction as it related to confederacies, had not ſo much as a pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, there being no former ties betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and them, nor common intereſt, as of one incorporation, neceſſitating them to this mixture; but God had ſet a partition-wall betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and them: and ſo <hi>Ephraims</hi> conjunction with them was volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and ſinfully choſen by him; And therefore this mixture, and all other circumſtantiate, are to be condemned. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The viſible Church is obnoxious to great hazard in the world, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114928:76"/>
of wicked ſocieties and falſe Religions without, which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide her ſnares and dangers from enemies in her boſome,) are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to corrupt her; For, there are <hi>the people,</hi> and Nations about, who drew them from God. 2. The great hazard of corruption of the viſible Church, even by theſe who are without, is not ſo much from them or their endeavours, as from her ſelfe, who hath by nature ſuch a principle, as will ſoon draw her to the wrong way to joyne with others, whereas they have no ſuch principle to ſet them right: For, <hi>Ephraim mixeth himſelf among the people,</hi> and that is his undoing. 3. The declinings of the viſible Church, and her debordings after the cuſtomes of Idolaters, and the reſt of the world, is oft-times juſtly put upon the accompt of the Rulers, who upon their politick deſignes do thus intangle and miſlead her: For, <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or the Kingly tribe is charged with this; and it was their Rulers who drew on theſe confederacies and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 4. Such as once begin to decline, and go wrong in the matters of Religion, cannot ſet bounds to themſelves, nor be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, but they will go further wrong: For, <hi>Ephraim</hi> reſted not at the Idolatry of the calves, but <hi>mixed himſelf among the people.</hi> That ſame policy that pleaded for the calves, ſerved alſo to urge their conformity with Heathen Idolaters. 5. Wicked ſocieties are dangerous, and ſo contagious, that as we are to guard againſt infection by reaſon of neceſſary conjunction with wicked men, when we are united with them in place and common intereſts, (which is our affliction, and not our ſin,) ſo eſpecially we are to beware of voluntary conjunction with them, when no ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity can be pretended; For, this alſo was a part of <hi>Ephraims</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, his joyning in converſe and confederacies with them, drew on mixture with them in their Religion. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106 35. 6. Mixtures in Religion turneth men mungrels, and halters in the matter of Religion, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. and ſo worſe then the very Heathen, who are zealous and fervent for the Religion they own, and againſt that which is oppoſite to it; yea, mixtures will ſoon reſolve in furious frowardneſſe in that which is wrong, and cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in and averſeneſſe from the true Religion. Both theſe are imported in this effect of their mixture, <hi>Ephraim is a cake not turned,</hi> as is before explained. And it is like at firſt they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to a reſpect to both, and that they would not abandon God nor his Worſhip, whatever other courſe they followed. But at laſt their corrupt courſes did firſt abate their zeal in Gods way, and then put it to the doore. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 15 6.</p>

                     <p>The eighth ſin for which they are challenged, is their ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty under rods and afflictions. Their caſe is held forth, firſt, in proper termes, that all their warlike power and riches was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by ſtrangers, by theſe to whom they ſought, and others, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.4, 7. Then it is held forth in figurative termes, that they were like a man beginning to over-ſpread with gray haires, that is, either their great trouble had ſuddenly altered and waſted them, and made them look like their grave, or they had been long under troubles, even to old age; and yet the challenge is, that they conſidered not all this, to make right uſe of it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The viſible Church never makes defection, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the true Religion, but to their own prejudice. Even ſuch as they joyn with, and ſtudy to pleaſe by corrupting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, prove ordinarily their ſcourge; For, <hi>ſtrangers</hi> (theſe with whom they mixed, <hi>v.</hi> 8. or ſome like unto them) <hi>have devoured his ſtrength.</hi> 2. Whatever ſtrength or power a Nation may ſeem to have, yet when God is angry, and bloweth upon it, and deſerts them, it will ſoon be ſwallowed up; For, when God is provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſert flouriſhing <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then <hi>ſtrangers have devoured his ſtrength.</hi> 3. When ſin is once entertained, men become ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, that they will not heed difficulties in their way, nor be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded by them to follow their courſe; For, <hi>he knoweth it not,</hi> or doth not regard it. A little trouble would diſcourage them in a good way, but nothing will break off the courſe of their ſinne. 4. When men become ſtupid in ſin, they will reap no profit by their afflictions, be they never ſo ſore, or of ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; For, let <hi>gray haires be here and there upon him, yet he be knoweth it not.</hi> 5. Albeit ſinners may, and will feel the ſmart of afflictions, yet God doth not take notice of that, ſo long as they are not led in to ſee the fountain and cauſe of their trouble, and to get the right uſe of it; For, it is in this reſpect the Lord ſaith twice, <hi>he knoweth it not,</hi> becauſe whatever they felt and knew, yet they regarded it not ſo, as to tremble at Gods anger in it, and to abandon the courſe of defection.

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The ninth ſin for which they are challenged, (which is alſo a cauſe of their ſtupidity) is, their pride in ſtanding out againſt God, and that they will not abaſe themſelves for all their trouble, to turne to God or ſeek him. See <hi>ch.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Pride is an horrid and deteſtable ſin, eſpecially when it drives the ſinner to ſtand it out againſt God, and when he perſiſts in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that afflictions make him bear the badges of his baſeneſs; For, under all this trouble, there is <hi>the pride of Iſrael,</hi> which the Lord here challengeth as an hainous ſin. 2. Mens guilt, and particularly their pride under affliction, doth convincingly bear witneſſe againſt them, not only by bewraying it ſelf, but by te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying their deſperate condition becauſe of it; For, <hi>the pride of Iſrael teſtifieth to his face,</hi> in both theſe reſpects. 3. It is a ſufficient evidence of mens pride, and riſing againſt God and his diſpenſations, when they are not drawn to God by their rods, however otherwayes they ſhould ſeem to walk never ſo cruſhed-like under them; For, pride teſtifieth in this, <hi>they do not return to the Lord for all this.</hi> 4. When the Lord ſends affliction upon his people, it doth call for, and the Lord may juſtly expect, that they ſhould not only ſeek to him for help, but ſhould ſeek himſelf and his face, rather then their own eaſe, and that (to the end they may come ſpeed in ſeeking) they ſhould endeavour conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and turn from their evil way; For, all this is imported in their duty which the Lord miſſeth under their trouble, they ſhould <hi>returne to the Lord and ſeek him.</hi> 5. As no outward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations will of themſelves prevaile with impenitent ſinners, nor afflictions, if they be not ſanctified, do any good; ſo in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, afflictions meeting with unſubdued hearts, will not better them, nor convince them of, or drive them from ſin to God; For, proud <hi>Iſrael do not returne to the Lord; nor ſeek him for all this.</hi> Such a carriage is a ſigne of ſtout-heartedneſſe. 6. The offer that is made to ſinners under the rod of love and of acceptance, if they will turne from their evil way, doth much aggravate the ſin of obſtinacy; Therefore, it is put in the challenge, <hi>they do not returne to the Lord their God,</hi> who offereth upon their returning, to prove himſel to be ſo.</p>

                     <p>The tenth ſin for which they are challenged, (and which is a branch of their mixture, <hi>v.</hi> 8.) is, their folly in not ſeeking the help of God, but of ſtrangers, in their ſttaits, herein reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Doves, whoſe ſimplicity makes them run on hazards, <hi>v.</hi> 11. for which the Lord threatens to involve them in the puniſhment of their ſins, and (alluding to the flying Dove) to bring them down as a bird in a net, according to the predictions of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in their Congregations, <hi>v.</hi> 12. From <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. It is an undeniable evidence of mens not turning to God, not ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in trouble, when their hearts are bent on wrong courſes, and ſeeking to other refuges; So much doth the dependance of this challenge upon the former, teach. They do not return to God, who <hi>call to Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> however they may pretend to do both. 2. As the Lord doth not approve of all ſorts of prudence, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that wherein the wiſdome of the fleſh beares ſway; So every ſimplicity is not commendable, eſpecially when it is not armed and guarded with ſpiritual prudence; For, it is a challenge, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim is like a ſilly dove without heart,</hi> or prudence, though it be commendable when joyned with ſerpentine wiſdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.16. 3. Whatever wiſdome or policy may ſeem to be in mens forſaking God and his way in trouble, yet it is in effect great ſimplicity, and will prove ſo; and whatever humane helps may promiſe, yet it is folly to think that men can help, when God in anger is a party, or that, when God is calling us to ſeek him by trouble, men ſhould deliver us without our owning of God; For, herein <hi>Ephraim</hi> is like a Dove, <hi>they call to Egypt, they go to Aſſyria,</hi> to wit, for help when they are in diſtreſſe. 4. Whatever folly there be in ſuch courſes, yet they are the uſual way which men take; yea, not only do they eſſay ſome of them, but they will rather be endleſſe in ſeeking after carnal confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on every hand, then they will turne to God; For, <hi>Ephraim</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:114928:78"/>
proveth ſuch a Dove, and <hi>they call to Egypt,</hi> on the South, and will be at pains to <hi>go to Aſſyria</hi> on the North, rather then ſeek to God. 5. Mens ſimplicity, and being thereby miſled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, will not plead excuſe for their ſin before God; For, this is laid to <hi>Ephraims</hi> charge, though herein he was like <hi>a ſilly dove.</hi> From <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. Mens not acknowledging of God in the uſe of means, or their uſing of unlawful means, provokes him to become their party, and to be againſt them; For, ſo doth this threatening following on the former challenge, teach. 2. Such as turn away from God and his way, do juſtly meet with ſnares in the wayes they follow, from which they cannot extricate themſelves; For, <hi>when they go, I will ſpread my net upon them,</hi> or cauſe them to be inſnared in unavoidable inconveniences. 3. Mens proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for a time in an evil way, gives no aſſurance but they will get a ſad fall, nor will it hinder God to reach them for that end; For, <hi>I will bring them down as the fowles of heaven,</hi> that is, as the Dove and other fowles do flie high, and yet they come down and are caught in a net; So though they ſoare high, yet I will abaſe them. 4. Gods ſad Word againſt ſin and ſinners, will at laſt take effect, and reſolve in ſad chaſtiſements; For, <hi>I will chaſtiſe them, as their congregation hath heard.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.6. 5. It may adde much bitterneſſe to the judgements that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on men, when they ſhall conſider how hainous it was in them to ſin ſo grievouſly, who heard God ſpeaking to them in their Aſſemblies, and that they would not believe their danger from the Word laying it before them, till now they are made to feel it; For theſe cauſes is their chaſtiſement amplified that it will be <hi>as their congregation hath heard.</hi>

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114928:78"/>
and to declare he behoved to deſtroy them, as was inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in that challenge and expoſtulation, Chap. 6.4. And for this end, he pronounceth a ſad ſentence againſt them, and demonſtrates the equity thereof, from ſeverall aggravations of their ſin, which takes away all pretences and excuſes from them.</p>
                     <p>In this <hi>ver.</hi> the ſentence is pronounced in a threatning of wo and deſtruction to come upon them, for their Apoſtaſy and rebellion, unto which is added the firſt confirmation of the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this ſentence, taken from their horrid ingratitude againſt God, who had redeemed and delivered them from many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles ſince the time of their deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet they lied againſt him, both in profeſſion and practice. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The ſins of the viſible Church are odious, in that they are not ſimple ſinnes, but Apoſtaſy and defection; as here is laid to their charge. 2. Apoſtaſy is in this horrible, in that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate not onely like a vagabond, runs away from ſo excellent a Maſter, contrary to his duty; but that he labours to bring an ill report on God, by fleeing from him, as if he were an enemy; for, <hi>they have fled from me,</hi> is the aggravation of their guilt. 3. Departing from God will ſoone draw men to moſt wicked and rebellious courſes; for, unto this is ſubjoyned, <hi>they have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed,</hi> or, <hi>rebelled againſt me,</hi> not onely by their Apoſtaſy, breaking all bonds, but this drawing on more inſolencie in ſin. 4. As Apoſtaſy and rebellion, is of it ſelfe a condition ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently plagued and miſerable, though no calamities followed upon it; So it will alſo at laſt draw on deſolation and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Gods curſe with it; for, <hi>wo</hi> and <hi>deſtruction,</hi> or <hi>ſpoil,</hi> a deſtruction with a wo in the boſome of it, followeth on their courſe, to confirme what a wofull courſe it was of it ſelfe. 5. However the Lord in mercy beſtow many notable deliverances on his ſinning people, yet that will not ſtop the courſe of their defection, and this doth highly aggravate their ſin; for, <hi>though I have redeemed them, yet they have ſpoken lies againſt me.</hi> See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.43. 6. The viſible Church doth lie againſt God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been delivered by him, either when ſhe denieth him in her practice, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. or, when being delivered, ſhe doth belie theſe profeſſions and promiſes ſhe made in trouble; or, when ſhe cleaves ſtill to falſe doctrine and corrupt religion, pretending it to be the truth, and conſtructs of Gods delivering her, as if it were a teſtimony that he favoured her way; or, when in her proſperity ſhe forgets God, aſcribing all her deliverances
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:114928:79"/>
to her Idols, as all her afflictions to him, as, Chap. 2.5. <hi>Jer</hi> 44.17, 18. In all theſe reſpects, it was the ſin of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> that when God <hi>redeemed them, yet they ſpoke lies againſt him.</hi>

Every ſhew of ſeeking even the true God, will not be accepted of him, and may be ſo far from preventing wrath, that it may haſte it on; for, this their defect in ſeeking God is one cauſe why wo and deſtruction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them. 2. Mens prayers how inſtant ſoever they ſeeme to be, yet are nothing before God, when the heart is not engaged in the duty, nor affected with that which is mens true miſery and the cauſe of their trouble, nor ſincerely engaged to God from whom they expect help; for, it is a challenge, they have not cried unto me with their heart when they ſought to him under trouble, albeit no doubt they were affected with the ſtroak, and ſeriouſly deſired to be rid of it. 3. As men who employ not God under trouble, will ſoone be broken and cruſhed with it; So the cries of ſuch, which flow onely from ſenſe of pain and want, and from ſpirits not humbled under Gods hand, are not onely inaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, but rather like the carriage of beaſts, then even of rationall men, much more of gracious men; for, in their cries, they but <hi>howled upon their beds,</hi> that is, their troubles caſt them, as it were, on ſick beds, and there they do not cry to God ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, but <hi>howle</hi> like dogs, who can feele and reſent pain as well as they do. 4. Men may make very ſolemne addreſſes to God, and keep very publick humiliations, who yet are not ſoundly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed nor accepted of God; For, <hi>they aſſemble themſelves,</hi> to wit, for ſolemne prayer, and yet in all this they but adde to the controverſie. 5. God doth juſtly reject theſe prayers, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſoever, wherein men are only driven by outward neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114928:79"/>
and their firſt and only ſuit is their own particular, never minding better things, or greatet wants: For, <hi>they aſſemble themſelves for corne and wine</hi> not ſeeking Gods favour and grace, and therefore are rejected. 6. Mens ſolemn worſhip is alſo juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected, when they never give over their ſtubborne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious diſpoſitions againſt God: But whereas mens calling on God ſhould engage them againſt ſin, they on the contrary, whatever they ſeem to be in immediate worſhip, yet they runne preſently after it to their old courſes in their ordinary converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and when they obtain their will at Gods hand, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſleight God, as if they had no more to do with him; For, this is another cauſe of his condemning their way, <hi>they aſſemble themſelves, and they rebell againſt me,</hi> that is, they retain their rebellious diſpoſitions, and albeit in the mean time they act no groſſe rebellion, yet they never purpoſe to give it over, but to be as they were, ſo ſoon as they have done with the duty, or God hath granted their deſire.</p>

                     <p>A third confirmation of the equity of the ſentence, (and a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence of their ingratitude) is taken from this, that when ever the Lord did in any meaſure reſtore the ſtrength and power of their State, which had been broken by many troubles (as he did by <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.25. and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14.25, 26, 27.) then they conſpired the more boldly againſt God, and plotted as if they would have caſt him out of the poſſeſſion of a Kingdome among them: That thus the <hi>binding,</hi> or <hi>ſtrengthening of their armes,</hi> is to be interpreted, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth from the contrary threatening, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The viſible Church doth oft-times caſt herſelf into many dangers, which would ruine her if God interpoſed not: and particularly, her abuſe of power, doeth juſtly make her power to be broken, as here is imported. 2. As God in his pity and long-ſuffering toward his ſinful Church, doth interpoſe for reſtoring her out of her deſperate diſtempers: So it is her great fault, that kindneſſe doth not gain her, but ſhe requites him with evil for good, as here we are taught, <hi>Though I have bound and ſtrenghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their armes, yet do they imagine miſchief againſt me.</hi> 3. The
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114928:80"/>
power and ſtrength and authority which the Lord conferres up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people, ought to be employed for him, eſpecially when he hath recovered it after many ſad breaches upon it; and it muſt be hainous guilt, when inſtead of being ſo, it is employed againſt him, and when a peoples recovery makes them more bold on ſin, and in caſting off his yoke, and contemning of his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; For, ſuch is their ſin here, they plotted treaſon and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, when their power was recovered. 4. Sin is ſo much the more hainous that men do fall in it not of ignorance, but of purpoſe, and do deliberate and deviſe upon it: In which caſe the Lord will reckon with ſinners as if they could or had acted all that they project; For, <hi>they imagine miſchiefe againſt me.</hi> He that taketh notice that all they attempted againſt him, was imagined, or deviſed and plotted, and chargeth all theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes againſt him, upon them, albeit they could not effectuate any thing to his prejudice.</p>

                     <p>The laſt confirmation of the equity of the ſentence, is held forth in a new challenge of their hypocriſie; that their repentance at any time, was nothing but a ſhew, and they aimed at nothing in it, but to deceive God, like a deceitful bowe that ſends the arrow rather any where then to the marke. Upon all theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations, the Lord cloſeth with a repetition of the ſentence, threatening that (for theſe ſins, and for their blaſphemies, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their falſe worſhip and courſes, and boaſting of their own ſtrength when the Prophets threatned them with judgements) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Princes ſhould be cut off by the ſword, much more the meaner ſort of people, and that in their <hi>calamities,</hi> they ſhould be mocked by <hi>Egypt</hi> their confederate. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as are very wicked, may yet have ſome ſhewes of repentance; and that they are ſo, is a great ſnare to themſelves: For, <hi>They returne,</hi> and this might be a ready objection againſt the Prophets chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges. 2. Whatever length men may come in externall ſhewes; yet they will not be approven, unleſſe they be through in their
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114928:80"/>
converſion, and turning to God, not putting on hypocriſie or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality in place of prophanity, or a leſſe odious vice in place of a groſſer, nor pleaſing themſelves with any leſſe then a through and reall change, from ſin to God, and a cloſing with God in Chriſt; For, it is their fault, <hi>they return, but not to the moſt high.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.1. 3. Such as would indeed repent and turn to God, ought to take up God rightly in his greatneſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, that ſo they may tremble to dally with him, and offend him, that they may be humble in their approaches, and may be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to come to him, who is ſo far above all things they can chooſe beſide, and who can make them happy, oppoſe it who will; Therefore is he here deſcribed to be <hi>the moſt high.</hi> 4. Mens ſhort-coming in the matter of repentance and converſion to God, floweth from their want of ſtraitneſſe in not intending what they pretend to, which is alſo a great ſin; For, therefore it is added, <hi>they are like a deceitful bowe,</hi> that is, as a bowe that hath a throw in it, doth never direct the arrow to the mark, however it ſeem to aime at it; ſo however they pretend true repentance, yet they do not intend it, but only to deceive and flatter God till they might get out of trouble, and then returne to their wonted cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and therefore it was that <hi>they returned, but not to the moſt high.</hi> 5. As the ſword is one of Gods ſcourges whereby he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſeth his ſinful people: So great ones need not think to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, when God draweth it, nor need people place their hope of ſafety in their Rulers, who by having chief hand in the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the time, do provoke God to have a ſpecial controverſie againſt them; For, <hi>their Princes ſhall fall by the ſword.</hi> 6. Mens blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous inſolency in defending ſin when God by his ſervants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth it, &amp; glorying in their own ſtrength, when God threatens, is an hainous provocation, eſpecially when they dare utter and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it, and it is a provocation that will not eſcape vengeance; For, this ſeemeth eſpecially to have been <hi>the rage of their tongue,</hi> which is put in the ſentence, that it might not be forgotten as a chief cauſe of their ſtroak. 7.

And by theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions of reproofes and threatnings, the Lord would inculcate upon them what was their duty, would vindicate his own juſtice, clear his long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and patience, terrifie them from ſin, and put them to ſilence who were ready to murmur againſt his proceeding.</p>
                  <p>In the Chap. there is; Firſt, A generall propoſition of ſpeedy judgement to come upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their ſin, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing they could pretend to the contrary, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2, 3. Secondly, The cauſes of this judgement are ſpecified, and the judgements for theſe cauſes particularized. The firſt cauſe is, their ſinfull change of civill government, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. — the ſecond cauſe is the Idolatry of the calves to maintain this change, which ſhould be their ruine, <hi>v.</hi>—4. Seeing thereby, and by their continuing therein, they provoked God to anger, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. And ſince the calves were their own vain invention; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God would prove the vanity of theſe Idols by the deſtroying of them, <hi>ver.</hi> 6.

The third cauſe of the judgement is, their ſeeking to the heathen for help, to uphold them in that their Kingdome and Idolatry, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.

Thirdly, in the cloſe of the Chap. <hi>Judah</hi> is taken in with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as being as buſie in multiplying and truſting in fenced Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in ſetting up Idolatry; for which the

                     <p>IN this generall propoſition, they are accuſed for violating the Lords Covenant, and ſinning againſt the written Law; and therefore the Prophet is commanded, as Gods Herald, to denounce that the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall come ſpeedily and violently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, as an Eagle doth on the prey, and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were Gods people. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. The clear purpoſe of God concerning his people and their courſes, is to be had from the Word; Therefore the Prophet is to denounce it, and to give the moſt certain ſound concerning it. 2. As the Lords Miniſters, ought freely, fully, and boldly to publiſh in his Name, a peoples ſin, and danger thereby, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 58.1. So denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of judgements in Gods Name againſt ſin, will prove a dreadfull ſound in end, eſpecially when it comes to execution; for, <hi>ſet the trumpet to thy mouth,</hi> alludes to the cuſtome of Heralds denouncing warre, and of a Centinell giving an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of a preſent enemy, which uſe to be terrible. 3. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a viſible Church do not preſently ceaſe to be a Church, when they fall in ſin againſt God: (for <hi>Iſrael</hi> here continueth to be <hi>the houſe of the Lord,</hi> For it is ſpoken of them, and not of <hi>Judah</hi> and the Temple there) yet their faire titles and priviledges of being a Church will not keep off a ſtroak, when it is procured by ſin; For, albeit <hi>Iſrael</hi> be Gods people and houſe and family ſtill, and they glory in that title, yet <hi>he ſhall come againſt the houſe of the Lord,</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſhall come.

binde our duty upon us, not only by his ſupreme and abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but by Covenant and mutuall ſtipulation, and yet we rebell; For, albeit there was a Covenant, importing their own conſent, and Gods gracious promiſe to reward their endeavours; yet <hi>they have tranſgreſſed my Covenant,</hi> called his, becauſe it came of him, that they were treated with in theſe tearms, and to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their impiety, who dealt ſo in Gods Covenant, as could not be juſtified in a Covenant with very equals. 7. However the Lord condeſcend to enter in a Covenant with his people, and crave their conſent to their duty, yet men will not aſſoile themſelves from ſin, by renouncing their own conſent, being bound by the Law of a ſovereign Lord, as well as by an agreed upon Covenant; Therefore it is added, <hi>and treſpaſſed againſt my Law.</hi> 8.

                     <p>This ſentence is further confirmed by refuting what <hi>Iſrael</hi> might have to ſay againſt this threatning, or to plead for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when it ſhould be executed. For whereas they would alleadge in their diſtreſſe, that they had intereſt in God by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and did acknowledge and profeſſe him, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. the Lord anſwers, that ſince in their practice, they renounced every good thing, therefore the enemy ſhould go on to purſue them, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. As God can make trouble drive the ſtouteſt ſinners to ſee their need of him; So an hypocriticall, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall and corrupt Church may be ſo plagued with deluſion, as that neither threatnings nor judgements will drive them from a conceit, but that they are good enough, and will be owned of God as ſuch; For, <hi>Iſrael ſhall cry, &amp;c.</hi> and go to God with their claimes, expecting to be regarded. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. 2. It is a great ſnare and occaſion of deluſion to a people, when they lean upon a ſtanding viſible intereſt in God, and truſt to their externall profeſſions, and to what they know or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in their judgement, without reſpecting their practice, or ſtudying to make that intereſt ſure unto themſelves in the Court of conſcience; For, this is <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſnare and pretence, <hi>My God, we know thee.</hi> 3 A true and reall intereſt in God, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114928:82"/>
and communion with him, is of reall worth and uſe in ſtraits; For, ſo much doth their practice teach, who finde a pretending to that their only refuge in diſtreſſe. 4. God will not be deluded or mocked with mens profeſſions or pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, but will examine them by what they are in practice; For, he puts them to it, and tries what they have <hi>caſt off.</hi> 5. As God is the only and chiefe good, and his wayes good, and ought to be ſeene to be ſo; So it will aggreage mens guiltineſſe, that they do reject him and his way though they be ſuch; For, it is his challenge, <hi>Iſrael hath caſt off the thing that is good,</hi> that is, God, his way of worſhip, and obedience to his Law. 6. Men are naturally ignorant of, and oppoſite unto their own true good, and all who forſake God and his way, will finde in end, that they forſake their own mercy; For whatever <hi>Iſraels</hi> hopes were in their defection, yet they have <hi>caſt off the thing that is good.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28. 7. When men once begin to turn their back on their own happineſſe, and on the way of God, they will ſtill grow more averſe from it, till they come to abominate and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre it; and this fills up the meaſure of their iniquity; for, the word in the Originall imports, <hi>he hath caſt off with abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or <hi>deteſtation, the thing that is good,</hi> and therefore the Lord threatens. 8. When men (and eſpecially the Church) leave off, and abhorre the way of duty, God will not let ſin thrive in their hand, but will ſend on judgements, and let them feele their loſſe in their ſtroaks, who would not ſee their prejudice in forſaking what was a good; For, upon this, <hi>Iſrael hath caſt off the thing that is good,</hi> it is ſubjoyned, <hi>the enemie ſhall purſue him.</hi> 9. It is a very ſad plague, when men cleave ſo to their deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pretentions to intereſt in God, that they will never ſee their errour, till judgements and Gods rejecting of them and their requeſts in trouble, refute them; For, this is the anſwer to what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. that for all they can pretend, <hi>the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſhall purſue them,</hi> and this ſhall refute their miſtakes.

this judgement, and a more ample and expreſſe declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their calamities, becauſe of theſe ſins. The firſt ſinne and cauſe of judgement, is, their civill Apoſtaſy, whereby we are neither to underſtand the election of <hi>Saul,</hi> which was not the peculiar fault of the ten tribes only, who are here challenged; nor yet the riſing up of ſome particular conſpiratours in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who long after the rent from <hi>Judah,</hi> did now and then uſurp the Kingdome; For, that was not ſo much the fault of the whole people, as of particular men, who made the people ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer under theſe alterations: But in this place the whole Nation is challenged for that rent from the houſe of <hi>David</hi> from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry firſt beginning of it, in the dayes of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who made the golden calves, of which the Lord ſpeakes next in the ſame <hi>ver.</hi> The ſin charged upon them in this civill Apoſtaſy, is, that however the Lord foretold the renting of the Kingdome from the poſterity of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that he would give ten tribes to <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam;</hi> yet the people and he not conſulting with God about the time and way of it, nor waiting for his command and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, did rent the Kingdome from <hi>Davids</hi> houſe, and ſet up a King and Rulers (or, a State conforme to their intended Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy) of their owne. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. However men be ambitious of ſoveraignty and rule, and may think themſelves abſolute and free in civill things, to do and diſpoſe in them as they liſt; yet change of Government is a matter of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance before God, and uſually is attended with much guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſin againſt him; For, ſo much is clear from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. 2. It is of abſolute neceſſity that men have a command from God to warrant their actions, without which men may do that which God in his ſecret providence, would have done; yea, and foretels he will have done, and by his permiſſion ſuffereth to go on, and yet in all this, ſin hainouſly; For, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God had foretold this change, and did let it ſucceed; yet becauſe they wanted a command, it is laid to their charge, <hi>They have ſet up Kings, but not by me; they have made Princes, and I knew it not,</hi> that is, I approved it not. See 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.28, 29. with Chap. 16 7. 3. Whatever may be amongſt men, yet length of time will make no preſcription in the matter of ſinne before God, but it lieth ſtill upon the guilty and impenitents ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, were it never ſo long, till God come and reckon with them about it; For, though they ſtood, and proſpered long after this defection, yet the guilt remains, and is laid to their charge, now when they are going into captivity.</p>

                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:114928:83"/>The ſecond ſin, and cauſe of their ruine, is, the Idolatry of the calves, invented to uphold this defection from the houſe of <hi>David.</hi> This is ſummarily propounded in this, <hi>ver.</hi> both in the ſin thereof, that they liberally employed their riches for that end, and in the puniſhment thereof, that hereby they did undo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sinfull alterations in civill matters, bring ordinarily ſinfull changes in Religion with them, and it is a black marke upon uſurpers, when they need a falſe Religion to uphold them, and make no bones to proſecute their end, though by ſuch wicked means; For, here the one change follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the other, as is more at length held out in the Hiſtory, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.26, 27, 28. 2. It is the great ſin of men that they not onely employ the wealth given them of God againſt him; but that they who were moſt ſparing and niggardlie in maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Religion, will yet be laviſh in upholding a falſe and corrupt way of Religion, as ſuiting beſt with their hearts; For, <hi>of their ſilver and their gold, have they made them Idols.</hi> 3. The making and ſetting up of Images in religious ſtate, upon whatſoever pretence, is a ſin againſt God, bewraying mens carnall diſpoſitions, who cannot take up God ſpiritually, nor conceive him preſent and neere unto them, unleſſe they ſet up a carnal repreſentation; For, it is a challenge, <hi>they have made them Idols;</hi> wherein they conceived no Deity, but that they were a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, or viſible ſymbole of the preſence of the true God among them, who delivered them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. 4 Mens expence and labour in ſetting up, or upholding a falſe Religion is nothing elſe but pains and charges to undo themſelves; For, the jealous God will not let the corrupting of Religion eſcape unpuniſhed; yea, he will not ſtand to ruine the authors and countenancers of ſuch a courſe, were it even a whole Nation, before it be not plagued; For, <hi>of their ſilver and their gold, they have made them Idols, that they may be cut off.</hi> 5. Men will not get a corrupt courſe, eſpecially in Religion, excuſed upon pretence of good intentions; but all the evill that followeth on it will be charged upon them, as if they had no other intention, or aime before them, but to draw it on; Therefore it is charged upon them, that they do all this, <hi>that they may be cut off,</hi> as if they ſet themſelves of purpoſe to ſeek their own ruine.

                     <p>This Apoſtaſie in the matter of Religion, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment following on it, are amplified in this and the three fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes. And firſt, (which relates chiefly to the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their courſe) he cleares how the calves ſhould be their ruine, and the cauſe of their rejection; to wit, becauſe that ſin provoked God to anger againſt them, and that juſtly, ſeeing he had ſo long forborne, expecting their repentance, but to no purpoſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Such as abandon the true Religion, and do not acknowledge and worſhip the true God, as he hath revealed himſelf, will ſoone bewray their brutiſhneſſe, and what a reprobate ſenſe they are given up unto, by their changing the glory of God into a vile and baſe repreſentation; For, whatever deſigne <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had in this device, either to imitate <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els</hi> practice in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4. who had it from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> or to gratifie the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> among whom he had found ſhelter in his exile, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 11.40. or becauſe of the great benefit which men reap by this creature, yet it was his brutiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that he would repreſent the glorious God by a calfe. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.19, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> He mentions only one calfe, though there were two of them, 1 <hi>King</hi> 12.28, 29. and belike, many petty ones afterward; becauſe they were like other, and the ſame thing, and did but repreſent one and the ſame thing, though they were multiplyed for the peoples eaſe. 2. Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of worſhip and Religion is enough to ruine a State and Nation, were there no other controverſie; and will at laſt draw on ſad and inevitable judgements; For, <hi>Thy calf hath caſt thee off,</hi> or, provoked God to abandon thee with deteſtation. 3. Men who follow a falſe Religion had need of fair weather, for it will prove empty, and abandon its followers in their greateſt need, without peace or comfort; For, ſo the words will alſo beare, <hi>thy calfe will abandon thee.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.6. <hi>Jer</hi> 2.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.37, 38. 4. No ſtrength or power of any place, will availe to hold off judgements, eſpecially when the inhabitants thereof are chiefe in carrying on ill courſes; Therefore albeit the calves were at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet it is called <hi>Samaria's</hi> calfe, as, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.14. Not only becauſe it was the chiefe City, and ſo compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:114928:84"/>
the whole Nation, but becauſe their power and riches maintained that Idolatry, and therefore God threatens, were they never ſo ſtrong, <hi>Thy calfe, O Samaria hath caſt thee off.</hi> 5. As God is angrie, and that in great meaſure, (as the word imports) againſt Idols and corrupt Religion and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; So his anger againſt any ſinfull courſe, will ſoone make it vain and ineffectuall, as to any thing the ſinner expects from it; For, <hi>Thy calfe hath caſt thee off,</hi> becauſe <hi>mine anger is kindled againſt them.</hi> 6. Idolaters and corrupters of Religion, can never be innocent, pure nor juſtified of God, while they continue in that ſin, pretend to what they will beſide; For, ſo is here imported, that they have not <hi>attained to innocency.</hi> 7. Whatever may be mens thoughts of an inveterate cuſtome in ſin, taking away all ſenſe of it; yet in Gods account, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in ſin is no excuſe, but an aggravation of it, as making mens caſe the more irrecoverable; For it is a ground of expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, <hi>how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</hi> that is, how long ſhall I wait; expecting they will reforme this evill, and yet they do it not? 8. Albeit the Lord be long-ſuffering toward ſinners, yet his patience will have a period, and then wrath will be the hotter; For, this adds to the ſin, and <hi>kindleth his anger againſt them,</hi> that he hath cauſe to complain, <hi>how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</hi>

                     <p>In the ſecond place, (which alſo inſiſts chiefly on the ſin of the courſe) he confirmes yet the juſtneſſe of his anger againſt their calfe, and them becauſe of it, by ſhewing the vanity of that Idol, in that it was their own invention, and not Gods inſtitution, and in that it could not be a God to help them, being only the work of men: and therefore he threatens to prove its frailty, by the breaking thereof. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Mens fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing humane inventions, neglecting divine inſtitution, is enough to corrupt all Religion: and it is ſufficient to condemne any thing that is intruded in Religion, that it is but of men; For, <hi>from Iſrael was it alſo,</hi> imports not ſo much that they learned this from <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the wilderneſſe, or that they learned it not from Pagans, but deviſed it of themſelves (which yet is not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114928:85"/>
certain) as ſimply it it a challenge that it was their device, and not appointed of God. 2. Apoſtates are ſo ſottiſh, that albeit themſelves be the inventours of Idols, and they know what they are, yet they will ſet them up as relative objects of divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; For, albeit it <hi>was from Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the workeman made it,</hi> yet they cleave to it, and give it ſo high a roome. 3. Albeit ſuch as make, and ſet up Images in religious worſhip do pretend that they acknowledge the true God only, yet ſuch is the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and the bewitching power of Idols, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of mens hearts, that they will be found to aſcribe ſome Divinity and Deity to them; Therefore muſt the Lord prove that <hi>it is not God,</hi> which imports their hearts were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bewitched that way, though they pretended to honour the true God in and by them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.28. 4. Whatever eſtimation men have of Images, or whatever excellency or Divinity they conceive in or repreſented by them; yet it is ſufficient to refute them, that themſelves, who are but vain and empty things, gave them all the excellency they have; For, thus doth the Lord argue, <hi>the workeman made it, therefore it is not God.</hi> 5. As Images and other inſtruments of Idolatry ought to be deſtroyed and broken: So the Lord by a calamity on them will prove their vanity, to the conviction of all theſe, who would not ſee it otherwiſe; and this will be the iſſue of all other things that are too much deified; Therefore it is added as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the vanity of their calfe, <hi>but</hi> (or, <hi>for) the calfe of Samaria ſhall be broken in pieces,</hi> alluding to what was done with <hi>Aarons</hi> calfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.20. as the juſt fruit of ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>

                     <p>In the third place, the puniſhment for theſe ſins, which was briefly ſpoken of before, is amplified and enlarged in a twofold ſentence or threatning. The firſt is; that as their wayes were vain and naught, as if a man had ſowen the winde, ſo their hopes thereby ſhould not only be diſappointed and their Labour vain, but it ſhould prove hurtfull; their harveſt ſhould be a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114928:85"/>
and tempeſt. This is again illuſtrate from a new ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an harveſt, which though it may be true literally, that their corne-harveſt ſhould prove ſo; yet it ſeemes here rather to be a Metaphor, ſhewing that it ſhould be with them, as if the ſeed they ſowed ſhould either not grow to a ſtalk, or if it did, yet it ſhould want a bleſſing and prove no food, or if there were any increaſe, yet it ſhould be eaten up by enemies: So they ſhould reap no benefit by their Idolatrous courſes, or if they ſeemed to proſper, yet it ſhould not be bleſſed, but the enemies ſhould ruine all of it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. God is ſo jealous an avenger of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and corrupt worſhip in his Church, that he will undo a whole Nation, before he do not ruine theſe courſes, which they will not reforme themſelves; For, this ſentence cometh in as a reaſon and confirmation of his ſentence againſt the calves, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>the calfe of Samaria ſhall be broken in pieces, for they have ſowen the winde, &amp;c.</hi> that is, I will deſtroy the calfe, and for that end, I will deſtroy you, that it may come into the power of enemies, who ſhall break it in pieces. 2. However many men do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take courſes with great hopes, (for men do ſowe in hope) yet they do oft-times employ their pains to no purpoſe or profit; For, <hi>they have ſowen the winde.</hi> All ſuch as follow Idolatry, or any ſinfull, unprofitable, or ambitious courſe, their very ſowing and undertaking promiſeth no good event, it being but like winde and empty. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.29, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.1. 3. Not only may men expect to reap as they ſowe; but ſinfull and vain courſes will bring further diſadvantages, and raiſe a violent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt either in the undertakers conſcience, or outward condition, or both; For, <hi>they have ſowen the winde, and they ſhall reap the whirlwinde,</hi> which is a tempeſtuous winde, 4. Albeit the Lord do not alike ſoone diſcover the vanity of all ſinfull courſes, by his judgements; yet in due time he will do it, and make it the ſaddeſt judgement of all, that men ſeemed to reap profit for a while in their way, and then all is blaſted; For, ſome get not ſo much as <hi>a ſtalk</hi> of their ſowing; Some get that, and yet <hi>the bud ſhall yield no meal;</hi> and ſome whoſe ſucceſſe is more promiſing, yet are met with and get it ſaddeſt of all, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their hope and probable expectations, <hi>the ſtrangers ſhall ſwallow it up.</hi>

                     <p>The Lord by his Prophet proceeds to lay forth their third ſin, and cauſe of theſe threatened judgements, which is, Their ſeeking help from the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> or other heathens (as it is, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) to uphold them in their civill defection, and in their Apoſtaſy from the true Religion. This is illuſtrate by a twofold ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, 1. <hi>A wilde aſſe alone by himſelfe,</hi> a beaſt noted for ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſſe and ſhunning the ſocietie of men, and for fierce wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it will not be tamed nor bred to a yoke. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.14. <hi>Job.</hi> 39.5,— 8. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. This may be applied either to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:114928:86"/>
the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that they were a ſelfiſh people, who cared for none but themſelves, and ſo it was <hi>Ephraims</hi> folly to ſeek to ſuch. Or, to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who by this running from God, proved themſelves brutiſh, feirce and wilde. 2. The ſecond ſimilitude points them out (and eſpecially <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or their Rulers who led them on theſe courſes, as is before marked) as an impudent harlot hiring theſe paramours. This challenge is joyned with the former threatning by the particle <hi>For,</hi> to ſhew that it cometh in with the reſt of their ſins, as a cauſe of theſe former ſentences, as well as of that which is ſubjoyned to it. <hi>Doct</hi> 1. When men betake themſelves to ſinfull courſes, one of them will ſtill draw on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (for, their rebellion from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtaſy from the worſhip of God, draweth on more ſin to uphold them in their Kingdome and State) and when a people have gone far from God by their ſin, their ſtraites will readily drive them yet further away; as is here ſeen in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. As the people of God readily never go further wrong, then in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſeeking help in ſtraites; So it is their great ſin, not to ſeek to make their peace with him when he ſends trouble; to be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of his help and care, if they would ſeek in earneſt to him; to put confidence in the creature, neglecting him, or to ſeek to wicked Nations in their extremities; all theſe concurred in this ſin, <hi>they are gone up to Aſſyria.</hi> Where to <hi>go up,</hi> which uſually in Scripture is ſaid of them who go from other places to the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which lay high, is in this place no more then ſimply to <hi>go to Aſſyria,</hi> as in Scripture a man is ſaid to <hi>anſwer,</hi> when he but begins to ſpeak. 3. Let men eſſay what means of help they pleaſe in trouble, yet they will no where finde that tender kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and reſpect that they will feele in God, when he is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſought unto in ſinceritie: and particularly, potent and wicked States will never be cordiall to the intereſt of any, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as have any profeſſion of the Name of God, further then may be ſubſervient to their own ends; For, it proved very true of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> he was in their need but <hi>a wilde aſſe alone by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</hi> 4. The people of God, do, eſpecially by the ſinfull ſhifts they make for help in trouble, bewray ſo much brutiſhneſſe, and lawleſſe wildneſſe, as may diſcover much of their nature; and be matter of deep humiliation, if it were well conſidered; For, in this <hi>Iſrael</hi> alſo is <hi>a wilde aſſe, &amp;c.</hi> by doing this, he fiercely caſts off the yoke of Gods prohibition, and he takes theſe ſhifts, that he may not be neceſſitated to ſtoop unto, or employ God. 5. For this <hi>hiring of lovers,</hi> it teacheth, 1. That in employing ſinfull helps,

and confiding in them, there is a kinde of adultery and ſpirituall Idolatry, as well (though not in the ſame meaſure) as in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting the worſhip of God; Therefore theſe helps are called <hi>Lovers,</hi> as Idols are elſewhere, with relation to them as an harlot. 2. The viſible Church in her defection, may be ſo violent, and deſerted, as to go further wrong then other tranſgreſſours; For, they are ſo bent that they <hi>hire lovers,</hi> and are at charge to ſin, wherein (eſpecially as to the Idolatry they fell in by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,) they are beyond other harlots, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.33. 3. The Church declining from God, is juſtly contemptible in the eyes of all; Her intereſt is little regarded, and her love of no worth to any, unleſſe ſhe <hi>hire</hi> them. 4. Departing from God, and employing ſinful helps and means, is very prejudicial; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the event and iſſue, but even in the work it ſelf; For, whereas they might have had real and effectual help from God, if they had turned to him, without money and without price; now albeit their other helps did ſtand in no ſtead, yet they muſt <hi>hire lovers.</hi>

Now they had not only ſet up one in <hi>Dan,</hi> and another in <hi>Bethel,</hi> beſide that which God had appointed at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but had multiplied them on every hill, as, <hi>ch.</hi> 4.13. and almoſt every where, as, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.11. This they did <hi>to ſin,</hi> that is, not ſo much that they did this to offer expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſacrifices for ſin, as that the nature of their work was ſin: And therefore the Lord threatens that they ſhould have their fill of ſin by it, and feel it. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Albeit the Lord be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114928:88"/>
juſtly provoked to anger by all the ſins of his Church, yet their corrupting of Religion is his chief and great quarrel; and is the ſin in following of which, men contract ſo much ſtupidity, as they need to be frequently charged with it: Therefore doth the Lord fall again upon their corrupt worſhip, as his great quarrel, and the ſin wherewith they were moſt blinded. 2. When men once leave God, and the true way of his Worſhip, there will be no ſatisfaction in any other way of Religion they follow, and therefore no end of defection. For, <hi>Ephraim hath made many altars,</hi> not contenting himſelf with theſe he ſet up at firſt. 3.

As men are then moſt fearfully plagued, when they are given up to go on in their ſin, and periſh: So when men do not ſtand in aw of the ſin of their courſe, it is righteous with God to make them feel what ſin is, and how ill he is pleaſed with it; for, <hi>altars ſhall be unto him to ſin,</hi> imports both theſe, that they ſhall be given up to that ſin; and as they ſinned and cared not, ſo the Lord ſhould make it be ſeen to be ſin indeed, and make them feel how ſad that is.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond branch of the challenge, is, that in their defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſpecially in this ſin in corrupting the Worſhip of God, they contemned the Law or Word of God, written to them by God, looking on its directions as of little importance, and little concerning them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Word of God is the true touch-ſtone whereby mens wayes, and their Religion is to be tried and approven, and neither Traditions nor Revelations; Therefore, to prove the ſin of their corrupt worſhip, he chargeth them with contempt of the <hi>Law,</hi> or Divine Doctrine in that matter. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. 2. It was the great mercy and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, to have the Word and Oracles of God, for inſtructing them in the way of ſalvation; and it is ſo ſtill to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114928:88"/>
any who enjoy it, and they ought to finde and eſteem it ſo; For, it is an aggravation of his ſin, as the abuſe of a very great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that it was <hi>written to him.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.15. &amp; 147.19, 20. <hi>Rom</hi> 3.1.2. 3. As it is a great mercy that the Lord hath cauſed to regiſtrate his Will in writing, to prevent deluſion and miſtakes; So, he is the Author of the written Word, whoever be employed as Penman; For, <hi>I have written my Law,</hi> ſaith he, which is true, not only of <hi>Moſes</hi> writings, but of the Prophets Doctrine, the ſumme whereof was at Gods command, left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. 3. The ſubject matter of the written Word is great and excellent, far above the ſubject of all humane ſciences, as reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, the way of his Worſhip, and of mans ſalvation, and ſo making them great who embrace it; For, it is, <hi>the great things of my Law,</hi> not to be ſleighted nor contemned. 5.

worſhip without life and ſpiritual diſpoſitions, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, ceremoniall worſhip without an eye to the ſubſtance and thing ſignified, is nothing elſe but a dead carkaſe in Gods ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; For, <hi>they ſacrifice fleſh for the ſacrifice of mine offerings,</hi> that is, their ſacrifices, which they pretend to offer to me, if there were no other fault in them, of offering them in a wrong place, and by unlawful Miniſters, &amp;c. yet they are but <hi>fleſh,</hi> in reſpect they minde no more but the outward work; See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.21, 22, 23. 2. Moſt part of worſhippers follow the external duties of Religion no further then their own ends lead them, and mens own advantage is the upholder of all falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; For, <hi>they ſacrifice, and eat it,</hi> that is, they obſerve no rule of burnt-offerings, wherein all the ſacrifice is offered up to God, but of all of them, they muſt eat a part, as was allowed in peace, or thankſgiving-offerings; and ſo they regard their own bellies moſt. 3. However men cry up their own way, yet they will finde that want of a divine approbation will undo all; For, it is a judgement ſufficient, <hi>but the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth them not;</hi> See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18. 4. God will not forget unrepented of iniquity, though for a time he ſpare it, but will call ſinners to an account when it is leaſt expected; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, corrupt and formal worſhip juſtly brings all a peoples ſins to remembrance, and ripens them for judgements for all of them; Therefore, it is added, <hi>now will he remember their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and viſite their ſins.</hi> 5. When men have forgotten their old bondage, and walk ſo as if neither ſuch a ſtroak nor delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had been, the Lord is provoked to bring it to remembrance, by a new captivity; For, <hi>they ſhall return to Egypt.

deſtroy the Cities and ſtately Palaces thereof.

The ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of Idols, and of carnall confidences in Gods room, are the uſuall byaſſe of mens hearts, who when their hearts are not delighting in, and relying upon God, will not want ſomewhat beſide to ſupply that want; Therefore are <hi>building temples, and multiplying fenced cities,</hi> joyned together here, as ſetting up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in Gods room. 3. Idolatry in worſhip, and carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, do bewray mens forgetfulneſſe of God, whoſe authority prohibits theſe things, and whoſe kindneſſe to his people, ſhould engage them not to abandon his Worſhip, nor truſt in any thing beſide him; and particularly, how much ſoever men pretend to remember God by ſetting up Idols and temples to them, yet in all this they do but bewray forgetfulneſſe of God; For, <hi>Iſrael hath forgotten his Maker,</hi> (who not only created him, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced him to that dignity he enjoyed) in his ſinning, and the like is to be underſtood of <hi>Judah.</hi> 4. Mens placing their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in outward means of defence and ſafety, when yet they little minde the wrath of God againſt ſin, is an iniquity to be joyned in ſome ſort, with Idolatry in worſhip; For, this was <hi>Judahs</hi> ſin in <hi>multiplying fenced cities,</hi> which is held forth to be of the ſame nature with <hi>Iſraels building temples,</hi> becauſe both draw the heart from God. 5. As judgements inflicted in Gods anger, will eaſily (like fire) conſume moſt ſtately places; ſo the Lord is provoked to inflict theſe, when men put confidence in theſe things. Any thing a people and eſpecially the Church, put confidence in, will ſurely be plagued; For, becauſe <hi>Judah hath multiplied fenced cities,</hi> and made this his confidence, (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe it is no ſin to uſe means of defence,) <hi>I will ſend a fire upon his cities, and it ſhall devour the palaces thereof.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Doctrine of this Chap relates to a time wherein <hi>Iſrael</hi> flouriſhed much by reaſon of outward plenty, victories, confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies with their neighbours: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did harden and pleaſe themſelver in their ſinnes, whatever the Prophets ſaid to the contrary; Therefore the whole Chapter containes a large deſcription of the miſeries that were to come upon them for their ſins; which (according to the ſeveral repetitions of challenges for ſin,) may be branched out in four parts. 1. There is a deſcription of the deſolation to come upon them, to ſilence their preſumptuous and carnall joy; wherein he declareth they had no cauſe to be inſolent, thinking to proſper in ſin as other Nations, ſeeing their ſin, (eſpecially their Idolatry) was more hainous then the ſins of other people, <hi>v.</hi> 1. for which the Lord would ſend famine, <hi>v</hi> 2. would drive them into exile, where they ſhould not be able to obſerve the rules of the ceremonial Law, <hi>v.</hi> 3. and where they ſhould be deprived of publick Ordinances, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and of ſolemne feaſts, <hi>v.</hi> 5. and ſhould miſerably periſh, <hi>v</hi> 6. In the ſecond place, this deſolation is declared to be near, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord would diſcover the folly of their falſe Prophets, and their ſin, in procuring ſuch at Gods hands, <hi>v.</hi> 7. who, whatever they pretended to, were but ſnares to the people, and cauſes of Gods anger, <hi>v.</hi> 8. 3. They are charged with the ſins of their fathers, whom they imitated, hereby provoking God to call them to an account, <hi>v</hi> 9. and particularly, with ingrate forſaking of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. for which they are threatened, that God would cut them off without hope of poſterity, and abandon them, <hi>v.</hi> 11, 12. and that notwithſtanding their ſtrong and flouriſhing condition, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. and that this judgement ſhould be ſo ſharp, as it were rather to be wiſhed they ſhould not bring forth children, or that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the womb, <hi>v.</hi> 14. 4. Their ſuperſtition and Idolatry, wherein their Princes had chief hand, is again laid to their charge;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114928:90"/>
for which they are threatened with Gods anger, and rejection, and exile, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and with cutting them off root and branch, <hi>ver.</hi> 16.

                     <p>This Verſe containes the ground of all the ſubſequent threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe of proſperity, was inſolent in ſin, thinking to carry out as Heathen Nations did in their Idolatry; whereas they had leſſe ground to think they ſhould thrive, then any people: for their Idolatry wherein they perſevered, becauſe of their proſperity, was more hainous then the Idolatry of others, as being a breach of the Covenant of Marriage betwixt God and them, and like the carriage of an impudent horlot, who proſtitutes her ſelf for meat, wherever the occaſion is offered: So they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Idols that they might have plenty, as the Heathen had, and did confirme themſelves in their Idolatrous courſe, becauſe they enjoyed plenty, as, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men may have much ſeeming matter of joy, wherein they pleaſe themſelves, little inquiring whether God alloweth of it, which yet hath a worme in the root of it: For, ſo much doth this prohibition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, <hi>Rejoyce not, O Iſrael, for joy,</hi> that is, there is no cauſe why ye ſhould be ſo exceſſive in your jollity, as to <hi>rejoyce for joy.</hi> 2. Much proſperity affords but little cauſe of joy, when the favour is only outward, and God is angry for ſin; For, ſuch was the matter of <hi>Iſraels</hi> joy, and their caſe when they are prohibited to <hi>rejoyce for joy.</hi> 3. However the Lords people delude and harden themſelves in their defection, by conſidering the proſperity of the prophane world about them; yet they need not expect to thrive in ſin as others do, but that they ſhall be ſooner and more certainly puniſhed, and that it ſhall be ill with them, though all other ſinners ſhould proſper; Therefore are they prohibited to <hi>rejoyce as other people,</hi> whoſe Idolatry and defection ſeemes to proſper in their hand; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.32. <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. 4. The

greatneſſe of the Churches ſin, and of Gods anger againſt it, is not to be meaſured only by the act it ſelf, but by other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: And the ſame ſin is more hainous in them then others, conſidering their relations and engagements, and the multitude of means which they enjoy for ſetting and keeping them right; Therefore it is ſubjoyned as a reaſon why they ſhould not rejoyce as others, <hi>for thou haſt gone a whoring from thy God;</hi> That ſin which in the Heathen was ignorance, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. and a ſticking by their principles, though corrupt; is in them Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and whoredome, renouncing the true God whom they had acknowledged, and to whom they were engaged; and therefore it could not be ſpared in them as in others. 5. It is an hainous and abominable ſin, when men meaſure their Religion by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages, and do aſcribe Gods bounty to wrong cauſes, to harden themſelves in ſin; For, <hi>thou haſt loved a reward on every corn floore,</hi> imports ſo much: As an harlot proſtitutes her ſelf in time of harveſt, for ſome corne to live on, ſo ſhe followed the Religion which ſhe thought gave her plenty of corne in her floores, (and this was her firſt fault;) and ſhe took pleaſure in her proſperity, and delighted in it, as a reward for her ſpiritual adultery, and this was her ſecond ſin and miſtake.

There is nothing which men run out of Gods way, to ſeek after it, but it is righteous they finde the contrary; For, they left God, ſeeking plenty, and they finde famine. 2. It is juſt with God to take away outward bleſſings, when men are only bent on them, and idolize them; When men meaſure and chooſe their Religion by them, and ſee not God, nor are confirmed in his way, by his bounty toward them: For, it is for theſe cauſes that <hi>the floore and the wine-preſſe ſhall not feed them, &amp;c.</hi> 3.

                     <p>A ſecond branch of this threatened miſery, is exile from the Land which was the Lords in a peculiar way, as being his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place in his Church, and given to them as a type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that they ſhould be ſcattered into <hi>Egypt,</hi> whither many of them fled, and into <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> whither they were carried by the Conquerour: where by reaſon of want, they ſhould not be able to obſerve the diſtinction of meats preſcribed in the ceremonial Law, (which it ſeems they had ſtill obſerved in that particular, notwithſtanding their defection in other things,) or, ſhould be conſtrained to eat unclean meat, to the reproach of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or ſhould voluntarily conforme themſelves to the cuſtomes of the Heathen. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Captivity and exile are an addition to the ſtroak of ſcarcity, or any other want at home in a peoples own countrey; Therefore it is added to the former, as a further degree of miſery, <hi>They ſhall not dwell in the land, but return to Egypt,</hi> (where they were in bondage before, to meet with new miſery,) <hi>and Aſſyria.</hi> 2. Albeit now there be no land that is typical, and the earth be the Lords to all exiles, who walk in his way, yet this threatening of driving them <hi>from the Lords land,</hi> may teach; That it is the ſaddeſt of calamities, to be deprived of mercies which were given in ſpecial favour; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, to be deprived of the mercy of being in Gods Church and Family: For, ſo much mercy was imported in this type, which is now to be taken from them. 3. As for this effect of their exile, that they ſhall <hi>eat unclean things,</hi> it may be underſtood di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly; As, 1. That many of them were neceſſitate to eat for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and unclean meats in their exile, becauſe they could get no other. In which caſe, albeit it was no ſin to preferre the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114928:92"/>
duty of preſerving their own lives, to the ceremonial Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand about diſtinction of meats; as is clear in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, and in the matter of the Sabbath, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.1,—7. yet this ſhould have been a very humbling caſe unto them, and it ſhould have been looked on as the fruit of much voluntary ſin, and neglecting of the Lawes of God, when they were put in that condition, which laid ſuch an humbling (though not ſinful) neceſſity upon them, as they could not ſtick to theſe obſervaſions, which were a part of their glory above all Nations. And, ſo ought men to reckon when they are put to flee, or to be taken up with confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; diſtractions through tumults on the Sabbath-day, or in the like caſes: For, though to flee, or be diſturbed when God calls men to it, be not their ſin, yet it may be the fruit of much former ſin. 2. It may be conceived that their oppreſſing Conquerours, put many of them to eat meats which were forbidden by the Law, or polluted by being offered to Idols, that ſo they might trample on their Religion, and draw them by that practice, to renounce the profeſſion of it. In which caſe as it was not lawful to give obedience, as is clear from the practice of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 1.8. (and after that the zealous <hi>Jewes,</hi> as is mentioned in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, refuſed to eat ſwines fleſh at the command of Tyrants;) So their being put to this tryal, and their giving obedience, may teach; That it is the great miſery of men, &amp; the juſt fruits of their deſpiſing the rules of the Word, and of wounding their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and contemning the checks thereof, when they are put under the power of ſuch cruel task maſters, as have no reſpect to mens conſciences in things concerning which the Word of God is moſt clear; And it teacheth further, that they who voluntarily ſleight the Word of God in their ordinary walking and practice, will never be honoured to bear witneſſe to it or the truths therein, in a day of trial, but will much more tranſgreſſe, when they are put to it by terrour from men; For, albeit this was the height of tyrannie and cruelty on their oppreſſours part, yet that can no way aſſoile them, either as to their ſins procuring this judgement to come upon them, or as to the guilt it ſelf of ſinning againſt the Law, and renouncing of their profeſſion, and of fitting themſelves for defection by their voluntary tranſgreſſions. But, 3. This ſeemes to be rather true of moſt of them, that as they were not humbled under any neceſſity they were driven to: So they vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and without any neceſſity, did conforme themſelves to the practice of the Heathen among whom they lived. And the Lord, by driving them into exile among the Heathens, gave
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114928:92"/>
them up ſo to do, that ſo they who in their own Land did too much participate with Idolaters in moſt ſubſtantial parts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and were in reality as bad as they, might not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others with the obſervation of external rites, but might loſe the very external profeſſion of their Religion, and become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together like the Heathen. And ſo it teacheth; That when men do inwardly pollute themſelves, and do make defection from the ſubſtance of Religion, the Lord doth not reſpect an outward ſhew of purity, but will give them up to ſuch further defection, or ſuch calamities and ſnares, as may make them appear outwardly as they are before him inwardly and in reality; For, his giving them up to <hi>eat unclean things,</hi> was but the fruit and juſt reward of their inward pollution, and of their former defections from his true Worſhip. It doth alſo further teach; That whatever noiſe men may make abour the profeſſion or external ſhewes of Religion; yet ſuch as have loſt the reality thereof, will ſoon caſt off the very external ſhew, if they have a tentation; For, when they came to live among the Heathen, they gave ſpeedy proof (by their conformity to their way) of how little worth all their former pretences were, of cleaving to Gods way in many external rites, when yet they had made ſo foule defection.</p>

                     <p>A third branch of their miſery, (and a further effect of their exile,) is the want of publick Ordinances in their ſcattered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Theſe are held forth under the names, of <hi>wine offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſacrifices,</hi> and <hi>bread for their ſoule,</hi> or offerings for their ſins, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7.

Nor ſhould they come
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114928:93"/>
into Gods houſe, or that which they accounted ſo. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all which is, that as their ſacrifices before their Idols, were never accepted of God, but polluted them, however they boaſted of them; So the Lord would declare this, by depriving them thereof in their exile, where it was undeniable they could not uſe them, (however they pleaded for <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> within the holy land,) or if they did, it ſhould be yet more abominable. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Want of publick Worſhip is one of the rods wherewith the Lord plagues a viſible Church, when they corrupt worſhip, and become formal, and reſt on it; For, ſo did <hi>Iſrael</hi> finde, as is here threatened. Though in this the Goſpel-Church have an advantage, that publick worſhip is not confined to one land or place, as it was in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. Whatever be the mean eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation wicked men have of Ordinances, yet God can make the want thereof a ſcourge unto them, when diſtreſſe is upon them; For, this is a threatening againſt all, when their ſacrifices ſhould be <hi>bread for their ſoule,</hi> and trouble ſhould let them ſee their ſoule and life to be in peril, and yet they could not get a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice offered to God. 3. Whatever be the ſinne of wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, in depriving the Church of Worſhip or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; yet God permitting them ſo to do, is a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that he is not pleaſed with the Churches way in uſing of them, and they have been either ſo corrupt, or ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, as provokes him to ſeek to be glorified rather in their calamities, then in their ſervice; For, if <hi>they ſhall not offer to the Lord,</hi> nor <hi>their bread for their ſoul come into the houſe of the LORD,</hi> it is becauſe they did not indeed pleaſe him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and were not <hi>pleaſing unto him, &amp;c.</hi> 4. As the Lord taketh no pleaſure in any ſervice, but what is ſeaſoned with chearfulneſſe and humble joy; (for, he approved not of the <hi>bread of mourners</hi> in their publick ſervice, ſignifying that he liketh neither heartleſſe wearying, nor faint dejection in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him.) So diſapproven worſhip doth but render the worſhipper more and more polluted; For, <hi>their ſacrifices are</hi> but <hi>as the bread of mourners,</hi> which doth pollute.</p>

                     <p>A foutth branch of their miſery, (and yet a further effect of their exile, and an enlargement of the former, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) is, the want of publick ſolemnities of publick worſhip, (which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in imitation of <hi>Judah;</hi> keeping the ſame titles with them, and) which were matter of joy to them in their own land, and now the want and remembrance of them ſhould be ſad. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As all occaſions of publick worſhip, ſo in particular, the extraordinary and ſolemne times of Worſhip and other divine Ordinances, ought to be eſteemed of as ſpecial favours beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Church: Therefore doth he inſtance their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the matter of Ordinances, as being eſpecially conſpicuous in the want of <hi>the ſolemne day,</hi> and <hi>the day of the feaſt of the Lord,</hi> as they called their ſolemnities, in imitation of <hi>Judah.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4. &amp; 122.1. 2.

                     <p>A fifth branch of their miſery, (clearing yet more of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile, and how they ſhould be deprived of theſe Ordinances, and therefore comes in with the particle, <hi>for</hi>) is, that they ſhould
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:114928:94"/>
not only go into exile, but ſhould miſerably periſh there. When they ſhould ſeek to run away from the deſtruction of their own land, by going to <hi>Egypt,</hi> with whom <hi>Hoſea</hi> was confederate, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. their exile there ſhould be of long continuance; For they ſhould die and be buried in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Cities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and their own pleaſant places, where they had laid up their treaſures, ſhould be deſolate, and over-grown with nettles and thornes. He inſtanceth the condition of the exiles only in theſe who thought it beſt to flee to <hi>Egypt,</hi> rather then be carried to <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> that he might ſhew, that if this were the caſe of them who took the beſt courſe, (as they thought,) what ſhould be the lot of others? And to ſhew in particular, what ill iſſue their courſe took, who thought they would do well enough for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even when the utter moſt extremity had befallen their own Land. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A people againſt whom God is angry, when they ſeek to avoid one calamity, will readily run upon another: For, <hi>lo,</hi> (ſaith he, warning men to behold the iſſue of their courſe) <hi>they are gone,</hi> that is, they will not certainly flee <hi>becauſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> in their own land, and yet they meet with it in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Memphis,</hi> a chief City in <hi>Egypt.</hi> 2. When a people have entered into trouble and captivity, they are not to reſolve to have preſently done with it, (eſpecially, when as God in hot anger hath ſent it on, ſo the ſins procuring it, do continue,) but that they may have much more to go through, &amp; may die in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iditon; For, <hi>Egypt ſhall gather them up,</hi> (to wit, for burial, as is after explained,) <hi>Memphis ſhall bury them.</hi> 3. Though the earth and fulneſſe thereof be the Lords, and he will prove ſo to all his own; yet not only to be driven into exile, but to die there without reſtitution, is a ſad affliction, and an affliction the Church may look for, when ſhe provokes God till there be no remedie; For, ſo much doth this inſtance teach us. 4. Albeit the Lord ought to be acknowledged for mens pleaſant habitations, and for their treaſures, yet theſe ought not to be much doated on: For, when men do place their delight in them, and the Lord is provoked, he can drive men farre from theſe comforts, and lay them deſolate, as a ſpectacle of his anger: For, <hi>the pleaſant places for their ſilver, nettles ſhall poſſeſſe them, &amp;c.</hi> whereby it appeareth that the Nations whom the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſent into their roomes, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did not at firſt people all that Countrey.</p>

In this <hi>verſ.</hi> the Lord threatens, that this miſery and deſolation was neere, which is ampliefied from an effect, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould feel it, and ſhould then be made to know the folly and madneſſe of their falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who deluded them with vaine hopes, and ſhould know that they were given up to ſuch, as a puniſhment of their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to render the ſtroak the ſadder, and that it might ſurprize them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. However wicked men, being threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do put an evil day far away from them; yet at laſt it will certainly draw near, and the time will come, wherein God will make an impartial trial of mens wayes, which he ſeemed not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, and will recompence accordingly; For, <hi>The dayes of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are come, the dayes of recompence are come,</hi> or, are now near approaching. 2. Near approaching or incumbent trouble will be dreadful, eſpecially to the wicked, and (beſide that it will refute their vain dreams of eaſe,) will be more ſad then they in their ſecurity could dream of; Therefore is this prediction added to the former threatnings, that they may have more weight, ſince <hi>the dayes are come.</hi> 3. They who will not hearken to God, ſpeaking in his Word, are juſtly ſent to the rod, as a more ſevere School-Maſter, to teach them what they ſo much neglect; For, in theſe dayes, <hi>Iſrael ſhall know it,</hi> that is, ſhall feel the rod, and be made to know theſe things under it, concerning Gods thoughts of them and their way, which otherwiſe they heeded not. 4. It is the height of madneſſe and folly for men to be doating on plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant dreams and deluſions, and to be deviſing ſuch to themſelves or others, when yet God hath other thoughts and purpoſes; For,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114928:95"/>
                        <hi>the Prophet,</hi> or he who pretends falſly to that office, <hi>is a fool: the ſpiritual man,</hi> or he who intends to be inſpired by the Spirit, is mad, in ſuggeſting other things to a ſinful people, then they will really meet with at Gods hand. 5. When deluſions are riſe in the Church, and men do vent their unſound Doctrine, and this is readily received; then ordinarily the Lord will refute theſe deluſions by real judgements. Such a temper doth progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticate plagues and ſtroakes, and theſe will convincingly refute them, and let theſe men ſee the folly of them, and their own folly in leaning to them; For, it is in theſe dayes, that the falſe Prophets will be knowen of all, to be what indeed they are, and this alſo <hi>Iſrael ſhall know,</hi> that <hi>the Prophet is a fool, &amp;c.</hi> 6. The Lords giving up a Church to the deluſions of falſe Prophets and Teachers, is a fruit of their many ſins, and a ſharp puniſhment thereof, previous to other calamities; (for, that they have mad Prophets, it is <hi>for the multitude of thine iniquitie,</hi> and a fruit thereof, to draw <hi>on the dayes of viſitation;</hi>) And it doth ſpeak much of Gods anger againſt a people, and of their hatred againſt the true Prophets, and their Doctrine; For, of both theſe it may be underſtood, that this plague is for <hi>the great hatred.</hi> See 2 <hi>Theſſ,</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>

Things that are in reality moſt abominable and vile, may yet appear to the world masked with faireſt pretences and titles; For, <hi>The watchman of Ephraim was</hi> (or, <hi>is,</hi> for the Original expreſſeth no time,) <hi>with my God,</hi> is the pretence of theſe Prophets, which <hi>Hoſea</hi> propounds as their alleadgeance, that he may refute it. This people loved to have ſome who ſpeaking in Gods Name, might be for them and their way;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114928:95"/>
and they got ſuch as pretended, for office, to be watchmen, <hi>the watchman of Ephraim,</hi> and for qualification to be inſpired by God, and have near communion with him, <hi>with my God.</hi> 2. Deluded men and deceivers, their pretending to intereſt and nearneſſe with God, ought to endear him ſo much the more to the hearts of theſe who are his own indeed; that ſo they may make that ſure in reality, which others pretend to, and that they may teſtifie their indignation that ſuch courſes ſhould be fathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on him who is ſo dear to them; Therefore, ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, repeating this pretence, <hi>my God.</hi> 3. Deluded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luding Teachers, are the moſt dangerous plagues that can befal a people, and will moſt effectually inſnare them in ſin and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; For, <hi>but the Prophet,</hi> (whatever he pretend,) <hi>is a ſnare of a Fowler in all his wayes.</hi> His Doctrine, carriage and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings will entrap them, as a Fowler doth birds. 4. As falſe Teachers are hateful in themſelves, that they ſhould have any room in what is, or is accounted to be Gods houſe; and as their being permitted to infeſt the Church, is a fruit of Gods anger: So are they cauſes an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In the third part of this Chap. they are threatned yet further with miſerie, for their own ſins and the ſins of their Fathers, whom they did imitate. The accuſation and challenge for ſin hath two branches, whereof the firſt is, That they were deeply rooted and engaged in abominable ſins, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Gibea,</hi> (of whom <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.) were. And therefore ſince they had followed their example ſince their daies, the Lord would not ſpare them more then he did <hi>Gibea,</hi> but make them pay for all together. See <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.13. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Contempt of true Prophets, and delighting is deceivers and their deluſions,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114928:96"/>
will draw men upon abominable wickedneſſe; For, ſo much doth the connexion of this challenge, with the former ſin, of being taken up with falſe Prophets, teach. 2. As men once giving way to groſſe ſins, will ſoon involve themſelves ſo, (as in a deep mirie pit) that they cannot recover themſelves; ſo it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition to be entangled in ſin without hope of recoverie, and for men to be active in hardening themſelves, till neither the Word, nor mercy, nor judgement will work upon them; For, it is a challenge, <hi>they have deeply corrupted themſelves,</hi> as a man plunged in a deep pit, out of which he cannot be recovered. 3. As there is no wicked courſe or meaſure of ſin, wherein men have fallen, but the Church departing from God, may fall in it again; So the ſins of progenitors will be put upon the account of the preſent generation who imitate them; and this will draw to a great account: Therefore is it added, that they did this, <hi>as in the dayes of Gibeah,</hi> not only to ſhew that they followed their example, in committing lewd and abominable filthineſſe, and obſtinate defending of it, or the like groſſe abominations; but to ſhew that ſince they did imitate them, and continue in theſe courſes, they ſhould make an account for all together. 4. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the Lords ſuffering and patience, yet ſinners in one age may expect the ſame meaſure that theſe of another age have met with, and that Gods long-ſuffering will be ſadly compenſed, when he begins to reckon; For, as he ſpared not <hi>Gibeah,</hi> ſo he will puniſh them; <hi>and he will remember their iniquity, he will viſite their ſin,</hi> that is, in that day of viſitation, he will bring them to an account for all theſe ſins which they had forgotten, and might think he had taken no notice of them, ſince he forbare them ſo long.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond branch of this challenge, is, that of old, when God delighted to do <hi>Iſrael</hi> good, and took pleaſure in them, as an hungry traveller would do in grapes in a wilderneſſe, or a man in the firſt ripe figs, when the tree brings them forth firſt, before
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114928:96"/>
the full ſeaſon: yet they proved ingrate, and ſhamefully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſpirituall whoredome with that ſhamefull Idol of Baal-peor, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25 3. Yea, and they gave way to their own luſts and deſires, and ſatisfied them in chooſing and following of Idols. In all which it is to be underſtood, that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> their poſterity, had imitated them, and ingrately revolted from God: For which they are threatened in the following Verſes. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods rich and free love can put ſingular worth upon the worthleſſe, and make them honourable by their being precious in his ſight; For, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was <hi>found</hi> by God, <hi>like grapes in the wilderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>as the firſt ripe in the fig-tree, at her firſt time,</hi> it flowed not from any worth in them, but from his love that condeſcended to eſteeme them ſo, and deal with them, as if they were ſuch. 2. No external proofe of Gods kindneſſe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering or adorning with peculiar Church-priviledges and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, will engage corrupt men, but they will ingrately deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his goodneſſe, and turn their back upon him; For, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the effect of the manifeſtation of his ſpeciall love toward his elect, yet ſuch was the carriage of the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to their condeſcending Lord. 3. Gods ancient kindneſſe toward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, ought not to be forgotten by poſterity, and it will be put on their account, who notwithſtanding both that, and kindneſſe to themſelves in particular, do imitate the ſins of their predeceſſours; For, therefore is ancient kindneſſe mentioned here, to aggravate <hi>Ephraims</hi> preſent ſin. 4. The ſhamefulneſs of ſin will not containe ſuch as are deſpiſers and abuſers of mercy; For, <hi>they went to Baal-peor, and ſeparated themſelves</hi> (forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king God, who will not be joyned with Idols) <hi>unto that ſhame:</hi> They did forſake God, and without ſhame or bluſhing, did cleave to a ſhameful Idol, the manner of whoſe worſhip was abominable. 5. It is a dreadfull and dangerous caſe, when men give way to their affections and luſts, and let them rage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any abomination they pleaſe, without any reſpect to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or not induring any controulment: And particularly, it is a dreadful caſe, when men chooſe their Religion by their affections, liking that beſt which pleaſeth luſts beſt; Therefore it is added, <hi>and their abominations were according as they loved,</hi> whereby we are not only to underſtand that in that particular of <hi>Baal-peor,</hi> their love to the Midianitiſh women drew them to worſhip that abomination, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25.

                     <p>The particular ſentence and threatning becauſe of this ſin, is that albeit <hi>Ephraim</hi> gloried in their multitude, (according as was propheſied that they ſhould be many, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.19.) yet judgement ſhould almoſt conſume them all without any hope of poſterity. Either their children ſhould periſh in the conception, or womb after the conception, or birth; or they ſhould be cut off by the ſword, if they grew up. And to put the capeſtone upon all theſe plagues, God threatens to forſake them, which ſhould bring on theſe, and many other woes upon them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Poſterity and off-ſpring is in it ſelf a bleſſing, and matter of glory, though not to be boaſted of againſt God, or to confirme men in ſin; For, ſo is here imported, that this was <hi>Ephraim's glory.</hi> See <hi>Prov</hi> 17.6. 2. Mens mercies which in appearance ſeeme to be ſureſt, may be ſuddenly and irrecoverably plucked from them, when God pleaſeth; For, <hi>their glory ſhall flee away like a bird,</hi> which ſuddenly gets out of a cage, and cannot be recovered. 3. God hath advantage of men, at every turn and ſtep of their life, to deſtroy them when he pleaſeth; For, <hi>he can reach from the birth, and from the wombe,</hi> before that, <hi>and from the</hi> very firſt <hi>conception.</hi> 4. Such as God is angry at, he can make their preſervation from one ſtroak, prove but a reſervation for another ſorer ſtroak; For, <hi>though they bring up their children,</hi> (to wit, ſuch as periſh not in the birth or before) <hi>yet will I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave them that there ſhall not be a man left,</hi> that is, the moſt part of them ſhall be cut off; For, certainly ſome were preſerved. 5. As it ought to be looked on by ſinners as a ſad and juſt fruit of their ſins, when God ſmites their children, though it were by miſcarrying in the conception and birth; So in particular, the pulling away of children by the ſword, or other untimely deaths, after they are, with much pains, brought up to maturity, is a ſad ſtroak, wherein ſinners ought to read the diſpleaſure of God: as here we are taught. 6. Outward afflictions are not all that a wicked and impenitent people may expect, but
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114928:97"/>
that God alſo will leave them, by depriving them altogether of a Church-State which they have corrupted; by deſerting them, and by taking away all ſenſe and evidences of his favour, the bleſſing of afflictions, grace to come to him in trouble, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance and audience when they come; Therefore this is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Ephraim's</hi> judgement, <hi>I depart from him</hi> See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.16. 7. Gods forſaking of a people is in it ſelfe the greateſt of miſeries, it ſpeakes a wo with every affliction that is on, and threatens with more, till the ſinnner finde it ſo; For, <hi>Yea, wo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo to them, when I depart from them.</hi>

                     <p>A twofold amplification is ſubjoyned to this ſentence.

Proſperity is one of the great bucklers whereby men would ward off Gods threatnings, that they may not move nor affect them; For, this comes in as an exception againſt the ſentence, that <hi>Ephraim, as I ſaw Tyrus, is planted in a pleaſant place:</hi> that is, he flouriſheth, as ever the Prophet or any ſaw <hi>Tyrus</hi> do, or (as ſome read) as they ſaw a tree planted in the pleaſant places of <hi>Tyrus.</hi> 2. However when God is even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from a people, they may be in a more proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then ever; yet all that will not make his threatnings void; For, ſo was <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and yet the former ſentence ſtands. 3. The Idolatry of parents, is a ſpeciall cauſe of judgements on their poſteritie; For, ſuch was <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who <hi>ſhall bring forth his children to the murderer,</hi> or <hi>ſlayer;</hi> For, they are called <hi>murderers,</hi> not ſo much becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> had not a lawfull authority, as to point at the cruelty of their execution like mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond amplification of this ſentence, is held out in the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114928:98"/>
Prophets interceſſion, who fore ſeeing this miſery, would rather wiſh that the children came never to maturity in the womb, or that they died from their cradles for lack of ſuck, then that they ſhould live to be cut off in ripe age. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is the lawfull and neceſſary duty of Miniſters, and other godly men, to commiſerate and condole the miſeries of a viſible Church, and to pray for them, though they be moſt wicked and going to ruine: For, ſo much doeth the Prophets practice teach. 2. It may put god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men to a great ſtand and perplexity, what to pray for in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, when they conſider a peoples ſin, and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgements, that juſtice calls for ſtroakes, and that yet theſe are ſad and will undo them; and when they conſider that in times of calamity, there is no lot we can pitch on, but it may be made ſadder then what appears more formidable: So much doth the Prophets perplexity in his ſuite teach, <hi>Give them, O LORD, what wilt thou give?</hi> as wiſhing the peoples deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on the one hand, and yet pondering their ſin and juſtice purſuing on the other, which he could not but ſubſcribe unto; and as fore-ſeeing that however their childrens growing up ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a greater mercy at preſent, yet afterward it would produce a ſharper trial. 3. The fruitleſſeneſs or barrenneſſe of the womb, and breaſts, is from God, and he is to be ſeen and acknowledged in it, whatever ſecond cauſes there be; For, the Prophet ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth here it is Gods gift, <hi>give them a miſcarrying womb, &amp;c.</hi> 4. A Nations ſin may draw on ſuch ſad times, that in many reſpects it were a mercy, if parents had no children borne, or they died in their infancy, then that their children ſhould live to ſee theſe times, and be expoſed as a prey to ſlaughters, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, falſe Religion, Apoſtaſy, &amp;c. So ſoon can God imbitter the cup of ſinners mercies, and make the ſad private afflictions of ſome, in loſſe of children, be ſeen to be a mercy afterward; For, ſo much doth this wiſh import, that conſidering the ſlaughter that was to be of their children, <hi>v.</hi> 13. and other miſeries they were to endure, it were a mercy to <hi>give them a miſcarrying womb, and dry breaſts.</hi> See <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.23.</p>

Whatever be the Lords pitty and compaſſion through Chriſt, toward his own under their infirmities and daily eſcapes; yet Idolatry and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting of Religion will meet with hatred and indignation; For, <hi>there I hated them.</hi> 9. As God is provoked to take away his partition-wall, and unchurch them, who dare bring corrupt and humane inventions in the matter of worſhip, into his houſe: So this ſtroak is the capeſtone of a peoples miſery, and ſpeakes Gods great anger; Therefore it followeth, <hi>I will drive them out of mine houſe.</hi> 10. As the former effects of Gods love in outward things, may be cut off from a viſible Church without hope of reſtitution: So the want of theſe will be ſad, however his love in them was little ſeen or acknowledged, while they were enjoyed; For, it is a part of the ſtroak, <hi>I will love them no more,</hi> that is, give them no more outward proofes of it; for he ſpeakes in their tearmes, who would never think but God loved them, ſo long as they proſpered.</p>

It is the commendation of men to cleave to God and his way, and be zealous for him, though they ſhould do it alone, and to make ſure an intereſt in God, when common calamities are imminent; And God will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his intereſt in ſuch, in hard times; Therefore doth <hi>Hoſea</hi> name him <hi>My God,</hi> whom he had owned and been zealous for, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> had rejected him, whatever they pretended, and who
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114928:100"/>
would prove ſo to him in that ſad time which followed. 3.

It is righteous with God, that they who will not reſt nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in him, ſhould finde no reſt otherwiſe, or in other things, and that they become vagabonds among Heathens, who do not prize the communion of Saints, or of the viſible Church in her pure Ordinances; For, upon theſe grounds it is threatned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Iſrael, they ſhall be wanderers,</hi> (or <hi>vagabonds) among the Nations.</hi> 5.

                     <p>This Verſe contains a part of the firſt accuſation, wherein <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> is challenged for fruitleſſeneſſe, and bringing forth fruit to themſelves and not to God, and that they multiplied inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry, according as they encreaſed in wealth. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As the Church in many things doth reſemble a Vine, and particularly, in that they are good for nothing when they are not fruitful, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 15. and that God takes great paines upon them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.8, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 5.1, 2. So emptineſſe is her great and uſual ſin, having not only no fruit, or ill fruit, but empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, evaniſhing fruit: For, <hi>Iſrael is an empty vine,</hi> and thus alſo are they (as ſome read the words) <hi>an emptying vine,</hi> which poure out their ſtrength and the fruits of Gods bounty in empty and vain fruits, as a vine that bringeth forth nothing but branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and leaves. 2. When men improve all Gods paines upon them, and diſpenſations toward them, only in ſeeking of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or their own intereſts, it is their great ſin, and a proof of their fruitleſſeneſſe; Therefore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>he bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf,</hi> that is, they conſume all the fruits of Gods diſpenſations and care toward them upon their own luſts: Men are then indeed empty before God, and (as ſome read the words) <hi>their fruit is equal,</hi> or, <hi>like to themſelves,</hi> when the honour of God is not ſo much eyed in their way, as themſelves or their name; when diſpenſations are not improven to make them more for God, and when they are not publick-minded, rather then ſeeking their own things, 3 It is the great ingratitude of men, and a peculiar proof of their emptineſſe and ſelfiſhneſſe, when they are not the more for God, that he is good to them, but do
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114928:101"/>
increaſe in wickedneſſe, becauſe of Gods bounty; For, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth as a proof of the former, <hi>according to the multitude of his fruits, he hath encreaſed the altars, &amp;c.</hi> that is, when God ſent him plenty, and made his land fat, he erected yet more Altars to his Idols, and beſtowed more coſt upon his images. 4. Proſperity meeting with wicked diſpoſitions, is very ill to guide, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily proveth a great ſnare, drawing men to theſe ſins, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther want or ſlaviſh fear, kept ſomewhat at under in trouble; for, ſo much alſo doth this challenge teach. And therefore it is a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy when the Lord with-holds ſuch a ſnare from his afflicted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, till their diſpoſitions be more renewed.</p>

                     <p>This Verſe containes yet more of the accuſation, that they were divided in their hearts, partly betwixt God and their calves; partly, in the matter of their idolatrous worſhip, ſome being for the calves only, others for <hi>Baal</hi> alſo, as appeared in <hi>Jehu</hi>'s daies; and partly, by civil commotions, as, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15. Unto theſe accuſations the Lords ſentence is ſubjoyned, whereof this is a part, that God would ſhortly convince them of their ſin, and take them with the crime; This he was about to do by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when he ſhould deſtroy their altars and images. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the heart is a vital part, which cannot be divided without death; ſo men can have no life of God, nor acknowledgement of him, when they are not ſolely and throughly for him and his way, nor will he endure any halting betwixt him and Idols, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. For, it is his challenge, <hi>their heart is divided.</hi> 2. When men do fall from Gods way, it is juſt with him to give them up to ſtart and multiplie diviſions without end in their own way; For, thus alſo, <hi>their heart is divided.</hi> 3. Civil diſſenſions and commotions are the juſt fruit of mens halting, and declining from Gods way, and of their diviſions in the matters of God and his Worſhip: For, this <hi>dividing of the heart,</hi> followed upon the reſt. 4. It is no ſtrange thing to ſee men, when they commit groſſeſt ills, yet be very hardly convinced of it, conſidering their wit to defend, and their pretexts to palliate their courſes; and that men by continuing in ſin, do ſtill become more and more ſtupid; For, ſo is imported here, in that God muſt take
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:114928:102"/>
a courſe to <hi>finde them faulty,</hi> or, <hi>guilty.</hi> 5. God hath a ſchoole of judgements and afflictions, wherein he will teach and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the moſt obſtinate of their ſin againſt him; And this ſhould be looked on as near approaching, when men will not ſee their guilt from the Word; For, <hi>now ſhall they be found faulty,</hi> or, made to know their guilt ſhortly, when God ſhall ſmite them. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.35. 6. As monuments of Idolatry ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; ſo where men will not do it, but either maintain them, or are negligent in ſuppreſſing them; God will take the work in his own hand, and get it done by his judgements upon their expence; For, <hi>he ſhall break down their altars; he ſhall ſpoile their images,</hi> to wit, by the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as is cleared in the reſt of the Chapter.</p>

                     <p>Followeth yet more of the Lords ſentence, wherein it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that however they would not abandon their evil way, but looked to their King, whoſe authority they followed in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and whoſe power to defend them, they leaned unto; yet their King ſhould not help them, being ſhut up in <hi>Samaria,</hi> or deſtroyed, and then (as was threatened, <hi>v.</hi> 2.) they ſhould ſee their ſin procuring this, and their folly in looking to him when he was at his beſt. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1.

                        </gap>n, they uſed but empty words, and falſe oathes, obſerving none of them. This is amplified from an effect, that <hi>judgement ſpringeth up as hemlock,</hi> which however it may be underſtood of the judgements and puniſhments to come, that they ſhould be bitter and rife, and this weed is in the fields; yet it ſeemeth more clear, (by comparing it with <hi>Amos</hi> 5.7.) to underſtand it thus; That from their corruption and unfaithfulneſſe it flowed, that inſtead of judgement and juſtice, the bitter and deadly fruits of unrighteouſneſſe did ſpring up in all the Land. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. God cannot endure mens empty words and profeſſions, whether in Religion, or in their private commerce, when they have no more; For, <hi>They have ſpoken words,</hi> and but words. 2. As wicked mens oathes and Covenants with God or men, are no more to be truſted then their words; ſo it is the cauſe of a ſad controverſie, when it is ſo; For, it is a challenge added to the former, <hi>ſwearing falſely in making a Covenant.</hi> See <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.25. <hi>Ezek</hi> 17.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4. 3.

As mens profeſſions, and feigned pretences, will not hide the true nature of ſin from the All-ſeeing eye of God; ſo the pains taken on a people, to make them righteous, renders their injuſtice ſo much the more odious: For, notwithſtanding they profeſſed faire, and ſeemed to take pains, as on a plowed field, to bring forth good fruit; and notwithſtanding God had manured them, as men do their

He mentions <hi>the calves of Beth-aven,</hi> (or <hi>Bethel,</hi> as, <hi>ch.</hi> 4.15.) though there was but one there, either becauſe <hi>Bethel</hi> was the eminent ſeat of the calves, though there were but one in it; or becauſe both <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> were now <hi>Beth-aven,</hi> or, <hi>a place of vanity,</hi> or, <hi>iniquity,</hi> becauſe of that idolatry; or becauſe at <hi>Bethel,</hi> beſide the calfe publickly erected, they made little ones in their houſes like it alſo, and the Lord declareth all that, ſhould not availe. Afterward in the Verſ. he mentions only one in the ſingular number, <hi>(ſhall mourne over it, &amp;c.)</hi> to ſhew that they were all of one nature and kinde, and that one ſhould availe even as much as many. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Idolatry is matter of ignominy to any place or intereſt that ownes it; for, it turnes <hi>Bethel</hi> into <hi>Beth-aven.</hi> See <hi>ch.</hi> 4.15. 2. It doth prove the vanity of Idols, that their worſhippers cannot truſt in them, but muſt be ſolicitous and anxious about them in ſtraits; For, ſo were they about <hi>the calves of Beth-aven.</hi> This ſolicitude differs far from the fear of Gods people about his Worſhip and Ordinances in times of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (as, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.13.) which doth not flow from their diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God, but from the ſenſe of their guilt, eſpecially in abuſing theſe Ordinances, whereas they are afraid for their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, when yet they omitted nothing of their worſhip. 3. Any
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:114928:103"/>
thing that men place their confidence in beſide God, will prove matter of fear and terrour; For, ſo did the calves prove to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> in the time of their ſiege, <hi>The inhabitants of Samaria ſhall fear, becauſe of the calves of Beth-aven:</hi> it ſhould increaſe their terrour in enduring the ſiege, when they ſhould hear that their gods in whom they confided, are deſtroyed and not able to help themſelves. 4. Albeit corrupt Worſhip and Religion may ſeem ſtrange at firſt, to them who have been bred up in the truth; yet in proceſſe of time, and being attended with ſucceſſe, it may take with them who are not well rooted; For, whatever <hi>Iſrael</hi> thought of the calves at firſt, yet now there are <hi>the people thereof,</hi> (men devoted to them, who) <hi>ſhall mourne for it.</hi> 5. Such as are eminently employed in, and greateſt gainers by corrupt worſhip, have a ſad day abiding them; Therefore it is added in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that mourning is abiding <hi>the Prieſts,</hi> (or, <hi>Chemarims,</hi> of whom ſee <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.4.) <hi>thereof, that rejoyced on it,</hi> or <hi>becauſe of it,</hi> that is, who led a merry life, becauſe of their attendance on this Idol. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 6. The glory of Idolatry and of a falſe Religion, (being but borrowed and having nothing to commend it, but novelty and ſucceſſe,) will at laſt evaniſh and depart; And God will bring about this by judgements, when no other mean will effectuate it; For, ſo much is imported in this reaſon of their ſorrow, <hi>for the glory thereof, becauſe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it.</hi> This will be the lot of all falſe wayes, whereas truth, however men loath it for a while, will ſtill at laſt be found to be lovely, and to have a native unſtained beauty.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond branch of the ſentence, it is further threatned, that their calves ſhould not only be taken, and ſo be diſhonoured at home, but ſhould go into captivity, as a preſent to the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> who had conquered them, and in whom they placed ſo much confidence formerly: Whereby they ſhould have much ſhame of all their mad counſels to worſhip them, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes to uphold them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114928:104"/>
of the vanity of Idols, which men ſet up in Gods place, that they cannot ſecure themſelves againſt captivity, and from being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of, and triumphed over by Conquerours; For, <hi>It ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be carried unto Aſſyria for a preſent, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.1, 2.

                     <p>The laſt branch of this ſentence, is partly againſt the places of their idol-worſhip, (chiefly <hi>Bethel</hi>) and their Altars, which the enemy ſhould pull down and deſtroy, and they ſhould be deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and not frequented; as being the place of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, and not of Gods Worſhip; And partly, againſt the whole body of the people, whoſe miſery ſhall be ſo great, as they will rather wiſh to be ſmothered, then endure the incumbent and imminent evils. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The inventions of men in Gods Worſhip, are wicked vanity, and ought to be rooted out, and not purged; and God will ſee it done, if men will not; For, <hi>The high places alſo of Aven,</hi> (that is, chiefly <hi>Bethel,</hi> which is become <hi>vanity</hi> and <hi>iniquity;</hi> becauſe of them,) <hi>ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> 2. Corrupting of Religion, and of the Worſhip of God, is the crying ſin of a viſible Church, and therefore he will not ſpare it; for it is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſentence, that theſe places are the <hi>ſin of Iſrael,</hi> their eminent and ſingular guilt. 3. God will not ſpare to lay a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey deſolate, that he may put an end to corrupt worſhip, and make the places thereof deſolate; For, <hi>the thorne and the thiſtle ſhall come upon their altars,</hi> to wit, when there ſhall be no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple left to frequent that ſervice. 4.

                     <p>The third accuſation is, for their conſtancy and exceſſe in ſins That they were guilty of the ſins of their wicked fathers ſince the dayes of <hi>Gibeah,</hi> (of which, <hi>Judg.</hi> 19.) whoſe manners they imitate; or, (as the Original alſo will bear,) they are guiltier than in the dayes of <hi>Gibeah.</hi> This challenge is amplified, that albeit God made their fathers, (at leaſt the body of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) to ſtand, and ſpared them, when yet they were guilty of as groſſe abominations as theſe for which they did purſue <hi>Benjamin:</hi> (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe their Idolatry in <hi>Laiſh</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 4, 5, and 18.30, 31.) yet they repented not, nor keeped the impreſſion of that battel, and of <hi>Benjamins lot</hi> in memory for that end: And ſo was it now with them; they went on in their fathers wayes, and would not be reclaimed by the puniſhment of others. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Continuance in ſin through many generations, is a ſad aggravation thereof, and matter of a ſad challenge; And the ſins of a preſent generation, will bring the former ſins of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to remembrance, to be put on their account; For, <hi>O Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith he by way of expoſtulation and challenge,) <hi>thou haſt ſinned from the dayes of Gibeah.</hi> See <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.7. 2. The longer ſin be continued in, it groweth ſtill the greater and worſe; as being the more hainous, when it is againſt ſo many frequent admonitions and experiences; and ſinners growing ſtill the more impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the more they ſin; In theſe reſpects the other reading holds true, <hi>thou haſt ſinned more then in the dayes of Gibeah.</hi> 3. The carrying of a people through trouble, and their ſucceſſe and preſervation in a good cauſe, is no mark of divine approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their perſons, being guilty of groſſe ſins; For, <hi>there they</hi> (that is, their fathers) <hi>ſtood:</hi> or fought againſt wickedneſs, and were preſerved, and <hi>the battell in Gibeah againſt the children of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:114928:105"/>
iniquity,</hi> (the <hi>Benjamines) did not over-take them,</hi> that is, they eſcaped the danger, and were victorious, though many of them fell; And yet they ſinned then, wherein their poſterity did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them. God may make men ſcourges of ſin in others, who yet are but vile themſelves; may carry through a good cauſe in a peoples hand, with whom he is not pleaſed; and may ſpare a people, not becauſe they are holy, but becauſe he will not deſtroy the face of a Church, which would be, if he proceeded according to their deſervings. 4. It is a very great aggravation of ſin, when people perſiſt in it, without being bettered either by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others, or by their own ſparing; For, ſo is imported in this challenge, that though <hi>Iſrael</hi> eſcaped, when <hi>Benjamin</hi> fell, yet neither the one nor the other prevailed with their fathers; and they, their children, were as incorrigible as they.

                     <p>Unto this a ſentence is ſubjoyned in two branches; and firſt, The Lord declareth that he hath a purpoſe now to puniſh them, by expoſing them as a prey to the Nations. The amplification ſubjoyned in the end of the <hi>v.</hi> is made obſcure by the different acceptations of the Original text; They who read it, <hi>when I ſhall binde them for their two iniquities,</hi> or <hi>eyes,</hi> (that is, their two calves, which were dear and precious to them as their eyes,) do indeed hold out theſe truths; That their idols were the great cauſe of their ruine; and that delectable and ſweet iniquities will draw out the bitterer plagues; But the Original conſtruction and pointing will not bear that tranſlation. Therefore I adhere to that ſignification of <hi>furrowes,</hi> which is inſiſted on in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes, not ſecluding that of <hi>habitations,</hi> which may be alſo pointed at under that Metaphor of <hi>furrowes:</hi> and ſo the reading is, <hi>when they</hi> (that is, <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the enemies who ſhall be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) <hi>ſhall binde themſelves in,</hi> or <hi>againſt their two furrowes.</hi> Both theſe come to one purpoſe, that the Lord will thus puniſh them, when they ſhall unite all their ſtrength, and fix themſelves for their own defence, as a yoke of Oxen are coupled together, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:114928:106"/>
one in their own furrow to draw; And more particularly, when they ſhall unite their ſtrength in their two furrowes, or habitations, to defend their Countrey, and the two portions of land which they poſſeſſed on both ſides of <hi>Jordan,</hi> which were deſtroyed by two ſeveral invaſions of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. &amp; <hi>c.</hi> 17.6. And ſo on the other hand,, the people and Nations did thus deſtroy them, when they bent their forces againſt theſe two furrowes, or habitations, and drew deep furrowes of trouble upon them one after another, by making them tributaries, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.19. and by captivating firſt that part beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.29. and then the reſt, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Though God ſpare the wicked long, yet at laſt he will puniſh the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, and bring them under the yoke; For, albeit they were ſpared before, <hi>v.</hi> 9. yet now he will <hi>chaſtiſe them.</hi> 2. When God is provoked to anger, he will not only notwith-hold a ſtroak, but will make it bitter, by iflicting it ſo, as one that takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in it; For, <hi>it is in my deſire that I ſhould chaſtiſe them,</hi> imports, not only that he had irrevocably purpoſed it, but that being weary with repenting, and ſuffering their manners, he would now ſhew no proof of pity, but many evidences of his being well pleaſed with their ruine; See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 28. 3. God hath all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at his command to convocate and let them looſe againſt whom he will, and to make an holy uſe of their inveterate malice againſt his people, when they provoke him; For, <hi>the people ſhall be gathered againſt them,</hi> ſaith he, when he would chaſtiſe them.

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The ſecond branch of the ſentence, is, that albeit <hi>Ephraim</hi> bred themſelves delicately, and could not endure trouble or Gods yoke, (as an heifer would love to tread out the corne, (as was their cuſtome) becauſe it was eaſie work, and wanted a yoke, and afforded abundance of food, <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.4.) yet God would put a yoke upon them, and would put both <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> to trouble, and to endure bondage and captivity, as an horſe that is toſſed, and ridden upon in long journeys, and as an heifer made to plough and harrow. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a fault incident to our nature, to be much addicted to our own eaſe, and that which brings preſent content and comfort, and to abhorre any lot, or way of Gods ſervice, which proves contrary to that; for, <hi>Ephraim is on heifer that loveth to tread out the corne.</hi> 2. It is a great ſnare to men, making them to doat on an eaſie way, when they have been accuſtomed in Gods providence to ſuch a lot, and by taking too well with it, become effeminate; For, <hi>Ephraim is taught, and loveth to tread out the corne,</hi> that is, hath been tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with, and hath accuſtomed his own heart to that way. 3. God hath an indignation at ſuch as are too delicate and take too well with eaſe, and is provoked to put them to trouble; for, <hi>I paſſed over upon her faire neck,</hi> that is, I brought her under the yoke, who kept her ſelf ſo dainty, as if a man put a yoke upon the fat and found neck of an undaunted heifer. 4. Let wicked men tamper as they will, yet they will not get trouble alwayes ſhifted, but God will bring captivity and bondage, or other trouble upon them; for, <hi>I will make Ephraim to ride, &amp;c.</hi> that is, he ſhall be toſſed into captivity, as a man makes his horſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him in far journeyes. 5. The Lords ſentence is univerſal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſecure and delicate ſinners, that he will ſend toile and trouble upon them, be they leſſe or more corrupt; Therefore doth <hi>Judah,</hi> though more pure in many things then <hi>Iſrael,</hi> come in in the ſentence, <hi>Judah ſhall plow,</hi> which is an hard labour but ſeems to be diſtinguiſhed from <hi>riding,</hi> becauſe however <hi>Judah</hi>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:114928:107"/>
was oppreſſed in theſe times, yet they went not ſo ſoon into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, as <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 6. The hard lots of ſinners, may yet through Gods bleſſing, prove uſefull and profitable to them, however they may be ill ſatisfied with them; Therefore doth he expreſs their lot thus, <hi>Judah ſhall plow, and Jacob ſhall break his clods,</hi> which is the uſeful labour of husband-men, as is further inſinuate in the next verſe. I conceive that <hi>Jacob</hi> in this place is all one with <hi>Judah,</hi> diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or the ten Tribes, who are made to <hi>ride.</hi> Their name is doubled, to ſhew that no title of their intereſt in the royal Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> or in holy <hi>Jacob</hi> will hold off the ſentence, And their trouble is tearmed <hi>plowing, &amp;c.</hi> becauſe they were to attain to the fruit and iſſue of their trouble more ſpeedily then <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe threatenings are ſweetned with an exhortation to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and reformation of their way in tearmes borrowed from <hi>v.</hi> 11. The exhortation is twofold, to every one of which an encouragement is ſubjoyned, by way of argument preſſing the duty. He exhorts them that they would ſowe the fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, promiſing to make them reap the fruits of his mercy. 2. That for this end they would cleave up and manure the hard and wilde ground of their own heart, which they had neglected ſo long, and ſo impeded their own ſeeking of God; Upon the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment whereof, he promiſeth liberally to performe promiſes, to abſolve them from ſin, and to cloath them with Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord is moſt ſevere in threatenings, we are bound to look on them as containing exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to repentance, and promiſes to the penitent, in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of them; for, ſo is here cleare<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. And if this were heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened unto, who knoweth what mercy would make of the moſt deſperate perſon or people in the world? 2. The fruits of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the ſecond Table, are the true evidences of repentance, and of converſion to God through faith in Jeſus Chriſt; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he require <hi>ſowing in righteouſneſſe,</hi> or the duties of righteouſneſſe, not as if that were all their converſion, but as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114928:107"/>
evidences and fruits thereof. 3. Albeit God be not bound to our pains, yet he requireth diligence in penitents; And they muſt be content to performe duties, without looking for preſent fruit of recompence; Therefore is their dutie expreſſed in tearms taken from the painful calling of husbandry, and particularly of <hi>ſowing,</hi> wherein men muſt wait for the recompence of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 97.11. <hi>James</hi> 5.7. 4. Albeit the Lord doth condeſcend to have his glory manifeſted in a peoples obedience, and do alſo freely reward it, as if it were of worth to him; yet God doth not ſeek ſervice, becauſe he needeth it, but all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, is the mans own who performeth it; For, <hi>ſowe to your ſelves,</hi> ſaith he. See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.2. 5. However mens walking in wayes of righteouſneſſe, ſeem oft-times to be long forgotten, and lie like ſeed under the clod, which might ſeem loſt; yet in due time, it will reſolve in an harveſt of comfort and free reward; For, ſaith he, <hi>ſowe</hi> and <hi>reap;</hi> See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 126.6. <hi>Gal</hi> 6.9. 6. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the boiſterous and proud complaints of hypocrites, as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. yet ſuch as are righteous walkers indeed, and do flee to Chriſt in a Covenant of Grace, and draw ſtrength from him for the duties of new obedience, they will look only to Gods mercy, and not their own worth, for obtaining any reward; for, they look <hi>to reap in mercy.</hi> 7. Such as are thus brought in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies reverence, mercy will be beſtowed on them; and mercy will be the carver of their portion, and its out-lettings will be like it ſelf, and according to the promiſe; For, it is a promiſe, <hi>reap in mercy,</hi> or <hi>according to the mouth of mercy,</hi> that is, according to its verdict and ſentence, and according to the proportion it ſhall carve out, and according to the promiſes which God in his mercy hath made and ſpoken. 8. Men can reap no fruit of any ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diligence, till their hearts, which are hard and unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any good, be manured and changed, and put in a new and fruitfull frame; Therefore is the other exhortation ſubjoyned, <hi>break up your fallow ground,</hi> where, in a Metaphor borrowed from plowing, they are tought, that their hearts are as wilde and unaccuſtomed to any good work, as land that is not in uſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plowed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is hard and ill to plow; and that therefore the more paines muſt be taken upon them, by humiliation, repentance and mortification, to get them put in a frame. 9. Miſſpent time in neglecting or refuſing to ſeek God, ought to be redeemed and will be ſo by all them who are ſenſible of their own caſe; For, it is a reaſon of the exhortation, <hi>for it is time to ſeek the Lord,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how long ye have neglected it. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. 10. So
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114928:108"/>
long as ſinners are preſerved, and invited to repentance, it is yet an acceptable time, if ſinners will hearken; and ſuch opportunities ſhould not be neglected: Both theſe alſo are imported in this reaſon, that it was yet time, and that the opportunity would be laid hold on. 11. As ſincere ſeekers, do ſeek God only, and to enjoy him, as their chief ſcope; So they will not give over, till he come; for they <hi>ſeek the Lord,</hi> and that <hi>till he come.</hi> 12. As they who ſeek the Lord ſincerely and conſtantly, will not only finde him, but he will come over all impediments that they could not get over: (for, <hi>he cometh,</hi> and that maketh up the diſtance, notwithſtanding all their ſeeking;) So his diſpenſations to them will be liberal and refreſhful; For, <hi>he cometh and raineth righteouſneſſe,</hi> that is, liberally poureth out bleſſings, and refreſheth them after all their toile, in their wanting and purſuing after him. 13. God will eſpecially manifeſt his refreſhful liberality toward his people, in performing his promiſes which they wait for, and many of them in a ſhowre together, to compenſe long delayes; and in refreſhing them under the ſhadow of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, (which is their chief hope,) and in the rich and ample fruits thereof; for, both theſe are imported in this <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> he will <hi>raine righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe upon you,</hi> both his righteouſneſſe in faithful keeping of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and his imputed and gifted righteouſneſſe, which is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by the Law and the Prophets, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21, 22.</p>

                     <p>The laſt accuſation in this Chap. (which alſo is another ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument preſſing the former exhortation,) is, for their great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in ſerving ſin. Whereas the Lord by his Prophets, had frequently inculcate that exhortation, <hi>v.</hi> 12. to take paines on their own hearts, to bring forth the fruits of piety and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; They on the contrary took paines enough in ſerving ſin, wherein they wanted not fruit, though it ſhould diſappoint their expectation. This challenge is further amplified and enlarged, by ſhewing what was the fountain and ſpring of all this wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: to wit, their carnall confidence in the ſinful wayes and courſes they followed, both in matters of State and Religion, and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114928:108"/>
their confidence in their many valiant men. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Many are ſo perverſe, as they are not only content to live in ſin, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, but they will be at paines and induſtrious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſin, and will trouble themſelves to undo themſelves; So much is imported in this challenge, <hi>Ye have plowed wickedneſſe,</hi> or taken great paines about it, which ye would not do in your duty, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 2. Sin is a very fertile weed among the children of men; ſuch as are bent upon it, will ſoon get their hearts deſire of it, and God will give up ſuch as are diligent that way, to an height of impiety as a plague upon them; for, upon their <hi>plowing,</hi> it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>ye have reaped iniquity,</hi> whereby we are not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Gods cauſing them reap the fruit of ſin in judgements, (though that be truth alſo, and followeth in the ſentence,) but that their labours in ſin came to a ripe harveſt of grown-up ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. 3. Whatever fruit ſin ſeem to promiſe to its followers, or whatever preſent comforts or ſucceſſe men ſeem to have by it; yet it will prove but vain, and diſappoint them: For, <hi>ye have eaten the fruit of lies.</hi> Sin, as it promiſeth any thing to the ſinner, is but a <hi>lie,</hi> and the fruit of it which men ſeem to enjoy, is but <hi>lying fruit,</hi> and ſuch fruit as beſeemeth a vain and deceiving courſe. 4. Mens carnal confidences are great ſnares to draw them upon ſinful courſes, and are promiſing fruits which will diſappoint them: Therefore it is added, <hi>becauſe thou didſt truſt in thy way, &amp;c.</hi> Their confidence to bear out in a ſinful way, made them painful in it; and this is inſtanced as one of the fruits of their courſe, which ſhould prove <hi>the fruit of lies;</hi> and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for, it is a truſt not only in an object beſide God, but in what is ſinful. 5. There is no confidence that more readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares men, and will diſappoint them ſooner, then their own witty projects and devices in matters civil and ſacred, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Law of God; and their ſeeming to have power e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to manage and uphold them in theſe contrived wayes; for, ſuch is their ſnare here, which will diſappoint them, <hi>Thou didſt truſt in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men,</hi> that is, when they ſaw their counſels in Religion and State-changes, like to ſtand, and their Kingdome abound with valiant men; then they began to truſt that ſuch a courſe would ſtill bear out, and ſo were tempted to draw more furrowes of that iniquity, though it was but with cords of vanity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.18.</p>

                     <p>Followeth the Lords ſentence, wherein again he threatens all their confidences, and cleareth how they ſhall prove vanitie and lies. And firſt, for their mighty men, he threatens that they ſhall be ſurprized with the invaſion of the enemies, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with fear, that they can do nothing orderly. This is amplified from an effect, that not only the land ſhould be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run, but their very fortreſſes ſhould not hold out, but be ſpoiled and ſacked, according as they ſaw in ſome late example of <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> cruelty againſt <hi>Beth-arbel,</hi> which being no where elſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture, we ought not to be curious in enquiring fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever men dreame of their power and courage in a calme day, yet a provoked God will make a day of tumults and confuſions diſcover their folly; For, <hi>Therefore</hi> (becauſe of thy carnal confidence) <hi>ſhall a tumult ariſe among thy people,</hi> a tumult of invading enemies, and of confounded people, 2. Albeit that the dear people of God may have their own fits of fear and confuſion in times of calamity; yet not only is that not their allowance from the Lord: but to be given wholly up to that diſtemper, (as the wicked are) is a judgement from the Lord becauſe of ſin, and the fruit of carnal confidence, as this threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning teacheth. See <hi>Luke.</hi> 21.26, 28. 3. The Lords ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations toward Nations about, are documents to his people, and warnings of what they deſerve and may expect as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when they provoke him; Therefore doth he ſet before them that ſad example, which, as appeareth, was recent in their memory, aſſuring them it ſhould be ſo with them, <hi>as Shalman ſpoiled Beth arbel in the day of battel,</hi> when he overcame them in fight, and purſued his victory. 4. Impenitent ſinners, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne God becauſe of carnal confidences, do provoke him not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to purſue them with the ſword againſt their armies in the fields; But to give up their fortreſſes to the ſpoile, and expoſe their wives and children to the cruelty of bloody enemies; For, <hi>all thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes ſhall be ſpoiled,</hi> and they are threatened with ſuch a lot, as when <hi>the mother was daſhed in pieces upon the children.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.11. The ſpeech imports great cruelty, in that they ſpared neither mother nor childe, and in that they daſhed the children

                     <p>Secondly, as for their confidence in their way of Religion, and ſettled State, the Lord threatens, Firſt, that that ſore calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 14. ſhould come upon them, becauſe of their great ſin of Idolatry at <hi>Bethel.</hi> Secondly, that their King and Kingdome ſhould fall by a ſudden and ſpeedy blow. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Idolatry and corrupting of Religion, is the great wickedneſſe of a viſible Church, and the cauſe of ſaddeſt judgements, For, <hi>So</hi> (as is before threatned) <hi>ſhall Bethel do unto you, becauſe of your great wickedneſſe,</hi> to wit, which is committed there, and under <hi>Bethel,</hi> the other place of their corrupt worſhip are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. 2.

Impenitent Rulers and their Kingdomes may not only be ſore afflicted and waſted, but it may draw at length to utter cutting off, even though they be Gods people in viſible Covenant with him; for, <hi>the King of Iſrael,</hi> (and the Kingdome with him) <hi>ſhall utterly be cut off.</hi> 4.

                        <pb n="203" facs="tcp:114928:110"/>THis Chap. begins with a challenge of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ingratitude. And for this end, the Lord brings to remembrance his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and his benefits conferred upon them, and ſubjoynes what their ingrate carriage had been. In theſe Verſes, he calls to minde his love toward them in their infant-condition in <hi>Egypt;</hi> his preſerving and delivering them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as his adopted children, and as a type of Chriſt; and his ſending Prophets (particularly <hi>Moſes,</hi>) to call them to obedience, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fellowſhip with him in the uſe of his worſhip; which truſt theſe Prophets faithfully diſcharged: All which doth aggreage their ſin, and convince them of ingratitude, who walked ſo croſſe to the directions of the Prophets, and multiplied Idols and Images which they worſhipped. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Ingratitude and walking unanſwerably to many received mercies, is the great and crying ſin of the Lords people and Church, as this challenge teacheth. Unfruitfulneſſe under rods will not be rightly mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, till this ſin be begun at. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48. 2. The Church and people of God, are in themſelves very unlike the great dignities, to which he advanceth them: And particularly <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in a very mean and low condition, till God did forme them both into a diſtinct and potent Nation, and into a viſible Church for himſelfe; For, <hi>Iſrael was a child,</hi> or, in an infant-condition, not as yet grown up. No more like to the condition God put them in, when he increaſed and delivered them, and when he exalted and eſtabliſhed them in the promiſed land, then a child is like a grown up man. And at that time, they were not formed in a Church-State, till after their deliverance from <hi>Egypt;</hi> Which may put us in minde of the mercy of a grown up Church-State, under the Goſpel, and what obligations a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected reformation layeth upon them who attain to it. 3. Gods love to the Church is her firſt and great priviledge, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents her in her loweſt condition, when ſhe is unworthy and baſe, and which is the fountain of all his bounty, and ſo makes it comfortable; For, <hi>when Iſrael was a child,</hi> witleſſe and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, <hi>then I loved him,</hi> and this is the fountain of all his bounty after mentioned, <hi>Deut</hi> 7.7, 8. 4. The Lord will make his love to his people conſpicuous in their preſervation in a low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and under much trouble, when he ſeeth it not fit to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from it; For, ſo is ſuppoſed he dealt with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> preſerving them from being extinguiſhed by the fury of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> till he <hi>called</hi> them <hi>out of Egypt.</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.12. 5. The Lord alſo will magnifie his love in their deliverance
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:114928:111"/>
from trouble and bondage, not only ſpirituall, but outward alſo, in ſo far as is for their good; For, <hi>I called my Son out of Egypt,</hi> or brought him out with my invitation, by the Miniſtery of ſuch as were ſent to ſpeak to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and them, which I made effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall: And this was not only a type of the Churches delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from ſpirituall bondage, but a pledge alſo of his doing great things for his people. See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.19. 6. As the Lord doth oft-times manifeſt his love, and put ſpeciall honour on his people, by putting them to ſufferings and trouble, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5. So he will eſpecially make his delivering of them, proclaime his love and eſtimation of them, and his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar intereſt in them: For, ſaith he, <hi>I called my Son out of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> that is, he delivered them as his adopted children above all Nations, which he not only cauſed intimate to <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 4.22, 23. but made manifeſt to all the world by his aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into liberty, by an outſtretched arme. 7. This cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out of <hi>Egypt</hi> is applied unto Chriſt, and his coming out from thence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2 15. becauſe the Lord, in delivering <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> did alſo bring forth Chriſt. 1. As the head of his body the Church from whom he is inſeparable. 2. As the bleſſed ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> deſcending in the loines of his parents, and to be manifeſted in due time; And ſo as <hi>Levi</hi> payed tithes in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> loines, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.9, 10. So he came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the loins of his progenitours. 3. As in a type, The carrying of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and their deliverance from thence, being a type of his exile there, and his return from thence to perfect the work of mans Redemption. It teacheth, 1. That the Scriptures are a great and unſearchable depth, containing far more then our ſhallow judgements can reach or diſcern in them, as appeares in that the lot of Chriſt in his own perſon, is couched under this type. So likewiſe in the Apoſtles inferences on very words, and their being expreſſed in this or that way, as, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. And from his doctrine on <hi>Abrahams</hi> Sons, and of mount <hi>Sinai, Gal.</hi> 4.22, 23, 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in many other inſtances. And albeit this be no warrant for men curiouſty to dip into Scriptures, and multiply types and allegories, neglecting the literall ſenſe; yet it ought to humble all in their making uſe of ſuch a treaſure, and lay the pride of theſe who either contemne the ſimplicity of the Scripture, or conceit of their own skill and inſight in it. 2. The Lord hath a great reſpect and eye to Chriſt, in all his great works, eſpecially in his Church; And as this deliverance was great and notable, not only in it ſelfe, but chiefly as it
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114928:111"/>
pointed at Chriſt: So ſhould we learn to eſteeme of every thing, according as we ſee Chriſt in it, and as it leads to him. 3. It is a great evidence of the love of Chriſt to his Church, that not only as her head, be ſympathizeth with her in all her troubles; but that in the dayes of his fleſh, he would in his own perſon eſſay what had been her lot, and what ſhe might meet with, that ſo he might experimentally know the heart of a ſtranger, and be a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and faithfull high Prieſt; Therefore did he undergo exile in <hi>Egypt.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 8. It is a great addition to a peoples mercies, when they not only get deliverances, but have Meſſengers ſent unto them by God, to point out their duty, to direct them how to make uſe of mercies, and to put them in mind when they go out of the way; For, it is ſuppoſed here, as a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercy, that they had men who <hi>called them.</hi> 
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. The true touch-ſtone and triall of a peoples thankfulneſſe for mercies, is by their obedience to the Word, and their ſubjection to God ſpeaking in it; Therefore is this the firſt challenge and evidence of their ingratitude, <hi>they called them,</hi> and <hi>they went from them.</hi> 10. As God ſpeaking in his Word, doth oft-times get little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, even from his own people, to whom he hath been eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially kinde, (as this inſtance teacheth;) So when a people do not profit by the Word, their corruptions will be irritate, and themſelves grow ſo much the worſe as pains is taken on them; For, <hi>as they called, ſo they went from them,</hi> that is, they went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, and of purpoſe, and in contempt, the quite contrary way. 11. It is Satans great engine to draw men to contemne God and his Word, under pretext of diſreſpect and prejudice againſt the Meſſengers only; And however men palliate their ſin that way, yet in Gods account, that ſame very diſreſpect and hatred of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, is an evidence they are wrong, and a ſnare to lead them further wrong; For, <hi>ſo they went from them,</hi> to wit, from theſe that were ſent unto them, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but indeed againſt the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.8. 12. The contempt of Gods Miniſters and their Miniſtery and Meſſage, is a forerunner of Idolatry, and of defection from the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; Such a temper of it ſelfe is ready to go wrong, and God juſtly plagues ſuch, with giving them up to wilde courſes; For, upon this it followeth, <hi>they ſacrificed to Baalim.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.43. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. 13. When men renounce the true God and his way of worſhip, and turne Idolaters, they renounce alſo their owne happineſſe and tranquillity, which they do proclaime by their multiplying of Idols and confidences; For, they had
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:114928:112"/>
                        <hi>Baalim,</hi> in the plurall number, many Idols under that name. 14. Beſide the ſin of groſſeſt Idolatry, in chooſing a falſe god for the object of worſhip; the Lord cannot away with Images, put in any religious State, for repreſenting him, or to worſhip him in and by them; Therefore it is added as another challenge, <hi>and burnt incenſe to graven Images,</hi> a notable inſtance whereof we have in the golden calfe, wherein they pretended to do ſervice to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.4, 5.</p>

                     <p>In this <hi>v.</hi> the Lord records a further benefit conferred on <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> (which ſeemes to relate to his leading them in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) in that he directed their way, and tenderly conducted them in it, as a tender parent or nurſe leads a child by the hands, and lifts it up by the armes, and carries it over a rough piece of way. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.31. and, 32.10, 11, 12. Unto this he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth, by way of challenge, what their ingrate carriage was, to wit, that they conſidered not that he did all this, and that he <hi>healed them,</hi> that is, when they by their ſins, had made breaches on themſelves, he recovered them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. Yea, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them from all dangers, whereinto they might have fallen in that wilderneſſe. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Deliverance from bondage and diſtreſſe is not all that the Church needs at Gods hand; but her way, being delivered, may be ſo dark, and ſo rough, (as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Gods way is to fleſh and blood) that ſhe neither knoweth it, nor can walk in it, more then a child in a rough way; For, ſo is here imported, that they needed God to guide the way, and to enable them to go in it. 2. It is the Churches great advantage, that God who delivers her, will not leave her ſo, but will guide and carry her; For, after the former mercy, <hi>v.</hi> 1. it is added, <hi>I taught Ephraim alſo to go;</hi> By <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he underſtands the ten tribes, and albeit all <hi>Jacobs</hi> poſterity taſted of this mercy in the wilderneſſe, yet here he ſpeakes only of theſe whom he is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging for the abuſe of it. 3. Such is the Lords tender mercy, as that abuſe of former kindneſſes, doth not alwayes prevaile to withhold what further mercies a people need; He will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes caſt off a delivered people, but add new mercies, to make
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:114928:112"/>
their deliverance compleat, albeit they have not made right uſe of what they have received; For, notwithſtanding their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>v.</hi> 2. yet he added this mercy. 4 When Gods people are weak, and their way dark and rough, Gods guiding and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſpect to them, may yet give them very little to do, and make their lot very eaſie; For, <hi>I taught them to go, taking them by their armes;</hi> Their being alwayes in his hand, and lifted over impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, might make their path eaſie. Some have found even ſad trials more eaſie then their ordinary walking. 5. It is the uſual ſin and great ingratitude of a people, either to miſtake their own mercy, and account it evill and a cruell lot; or not to ſee and acknowledge Gods hand in it, when they are ſatisfied that it is good; For, <hi>but they knew</hi> (or conſidered and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) <hi>not that I healed them.</hi> Many choice mercies they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled, (witneſſe their murmuring at their deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> their loathing of <hi>Manna,</hi> and their repining at almoſt all their lots in the wilderneſſe. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 17.12, 13.) And they did not obſerve nor acknowledge Gods hand, as became them, in theſe mercies they were convinced of. 6. The Lords recovering of his people after their cruſhes for ſin, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of other dangers, are both rich mercies; and the one ought to be acknowledged as healing, as well as the other, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both get this name, <hi>I healed them.</hi>

                     <p>To aggravate their ingratitude, the Lord mentions yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kindneſſe manifeſted to them; in that he drew them to their duty, not by violent means; but by perſwaſions, encouragements and other dealing ſuitable to reaſonable creatures, and by many proofes of his love; And that, as a tender husband-man eaſeth his beaſt, by looſing it from its labour, and bearing the yoke when he takes it off, and laying meat to it; So he had eaſed them and gave them breathings and reſt; after ſome ſhort trials from their oppreſſours, and provided neceſſary refreſhment for them. All which kindneſſe they had abuſed, as here is to be underſtood, and is expreſſely charged upon them in the reaſons of the ſentence, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Naturally man is ſo averſe from God,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:114928:113"/>
and from holineſſe, that he needs to be drawn to it, and to have his inclination wrought upon; as here is imported, <hi>I drew them.</hi> 2. The Lords dealing with his Church, whether by his Word or diſpenſations, is fitted and ſuitable to man, as he is a rational creature; and ſingularly obliging, except men do even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce humanity; For, <hi>I drew them with cords of a man,</hi> that is, ſuch as are fitted to mans temper as he is a reaſonable creature, ſuch as exhortations, promiſes, threatenings, &amp;c. And ſuch dealing as men uſe to oblige others to them thereby. 3. The love of God, whether offered in the Word, or manifeſted in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, doth lay on ſtrong bands obliging us to duty, and it is an hainous aggravation of ſin, when it is committed againſt love; For, it adds to the challenge, that <hi>he drew them with bands of love,</hi> evidenced in his revealed Covenant, and many ſweet diſpenſations; and yet they would not be perſwaded. See <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. 4. The Lords people are not to expect, that becauſe he loveth them, therefore he will keep off trouble, when they need it, nor ought troubles to hide a ſight of his love from his people, whatever fatherly diſpleaſure they read in them; For, ſo is ſuppoſed, that notwithſtanding thoſe <hi>bands of love,</hi> they had ſometime <hi>a yoke on their jawes,</hi> which yet did not prove that his love did ceaſe. 5. The Lord will alſo manifeſt his mercy to his people, in giving them eaſe after their toile, and breaking the yoke of their oppreſſours, whatever be in the way; For, ſuch was his great mercy here, <hi>I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws,</hi> or <hi>above their jaws,</hi> that is, by lifting it off their neck, and over their head and jawes. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12 5.3. 6. It is alſo a very obliging and convincing mercy, that our food and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſaries, are provided and prepared of God for us, from day to day; and that the burden of our anxieties may be laid over on him and his providence; For, <hi>I laid meat to them,</hi> (as the owner to the Oxe) and brought it to their hand.

                     <p>Followeth the Lords ſentence for this their ingratitude, in two threatnings. Firſt, having ſuppoſed their being invaded, he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:114928:113"/>
threatens that it ſhould be in vain to think on <hi>Egypt</hi> (with whom they were confederate, 2 <hi>King</hi> 17.4.) for a refuge or retiring place. For they ſhould be ſubdued by the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and carried to live in his territories; And that becauſe they would not returne to God, when he reproved and invited them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever confidences or expectations men have, which har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them in their evill wayes, in hard times; yet it is folly to lean to them: For when men walk contrary to God and his will, he will walk contrary to their will, and blaſt their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; For, they would not hearken to God, becauſe they thought <hi>Egypt</hi> would either releeve them, or be a retiring place unto them; Therefore it is threatned, <hi>he ſhall not return into the land of Egypt,</hi> where by naming it <hi>a returning,</hi> he puts them in minde of their former bondage there, to check their folly in making it now their refuge. 2. As it may be expected by all, in a time of triall, that they ſhall be put to the exerciſe they have leaſt will of, becauſe that is a triall indeed: So in particular, whatever lot wicked men are moſt averſe from, it is juſt with God to put them to it; For, <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not endure <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> either to be ſubject unto, or be in exile there, and the Lord threatens, <hi>the Aſſyrian ſhall be his King,</hi> that is, he ſhall ſubdue and bring them under his dominion, and ſhall carry them into his own territories. 3. Simple ſinning is not ſo great a quarrell againſt men, as impenitency and perſiſting in it, after mercies ſhewed and offered, and means uſed to reclaime them: And it is not ſo hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, ſimply not to return, (which may be for a time, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or the violence of tentation) as to ſleight repentance, and invitations to it: All this is included in this reaſon of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>becauſe they refuſed to return,</hi> they not onely returned not, when they had gone aſtray; but they openly and avowedly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when they were ſeriouſly invited.

                     <p>Secondly, the Lord threatens them with an abiding ſword upon their cities, and their villages, which as branches, ſpring out from the cities, (or, on their bars, that is, their ſtrong holds, Rulers, and valiant inhabitants) and that becauſe of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

                     <p>The firſt part of this <hi>v</hi> is by many taken as a further threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they ſhould be in ſuſpenſe, and anxiety, being preſſed on every hand becauſe of their backſliding from God. Which though it be a truth in it ſelfe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.66. and the word doth alſo ſignifie <hi>to be in ſuſpenſe;</hi> yet the Originall conſtruction will not beare this interpretation, for it is not <hi>becauſe of,</hi> but <hi>to backſliding.</hi> Therefore I underſtand it, with the tranſlation, as a ſecond accuſation againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their backſlidings, to which they were ſo prone, that their inclination and courſe did ſtill hang, ſway and bend toward it. And if they were at any time in ſuſpenſe and doubt about their courſe, (as the word alſo imports) yet all that but tended to more Apoſtaſy, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their inclination to it in that no ſuch heſitation ſtopped their courſe. This generall challenge is more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the end of the <hi>v.</hi> from the ill entertainment they gave to the Meſſages ſent by Gods ſervants to them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding and Apoſtaſy is the great ſin of the viſible Church, to which ſhe hath a ſtrong inclination naturally, even in her beſt frame; any other courſe ſhe followeth, being but a motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:114928:114"/>
nature; For, it is a challenge, that they not only back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlide from what they attained, but are <hi>bent to backſliding.</hi> See <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4. 2. Mens hanging ſometime in ſuſpenſe, and having ſome inclinations to returne, will neither double out their point againſt the power of corruption within them; nor will it exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, but rather aggreage their backſliding, that it overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſuch banks: So much doth the other reading teach, <hi>they are in ſuſpenſe,</hi> and yet it tends but <hi>to backſliding.</hi> 3. The great backſliding of Gods people, is their backſliding from God and communion with him; which draweth on all other Apoſtaſies and defections: And every backſliding of the Church, in duty or worſhip, is a backſliding from God, in ſo far as men thereby, do renounce his prerogative to be the ſovereigne Lord, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their duty, and the way of his own ſervice; and do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce theſe wayes and means, wherein only communion with God is to be found and intertained. In theſe reſpects it is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged that they <hi>backſlide from me,</hi> ſaith the Lord. 4. God will not forget a backſliding peoples intereſt, and pretences of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in him, to aggravate their ſin; For, it adds to the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, <hi>my people are bent to backſliding.</hi> It cannot but grieve God, when theſe whom he hath chooſen to be his peculiar people, and hath put them in poſſeſſion of ſpeciall favours, and gained their conſent in part, do recede from him as unworthy, and do chooſe husks whereon the world feeds, as the only deſirable portion. And it is a ſad caſe, when all a peoples priviledges and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſerve only to make their ditty the ſadder. 5. As it is of the Lords great mercy, that he ceaſeth not to follow backſliders with Meſſages from his Word, (as here it is ſuppoſed that yet there were, and that diverſe and many who <hi>called them;</hi>) So by the entertainment that is given to the Word men may trie whether they have backſliden or not, or whether they be perſiſting in it, or turning from it; For, by this is the charge of Apoſtaſy and bentneſſe in following it, proven, in that they obeyed not the call, <hi>though they called them, none at all would exalt him</hi> 6. When the Lord by his Word reclaimes his people from their backſliding, it is not becauſe he needs them, who is glorious and high in himſelfe, but for their own advantage; For, he called them from theſe baſe things which drew them away, <hi>to the moſt high.</hi> 7. We are never free of backſliding but when God is moſt high to us, and in our eſtimation; and when he is exalted in our hearts, and in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his commands and directions, and conſcience made of his praiſe, the neglect whereof is an evidence of Apoſtaſy, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:114928:115"/>
portends more of it; For, ſo is imported, in that they are called from their backſliding, to come to him as <hi>the moſt high</hi> and <hi>to exalt him.</hi> 8. Backſliding is by ſo much the ſadder, and the cauſe of a greater quarrell, that it is univerſall; For, <hi>none at all would exalt him,</hi> but all refuſed the call.

                     <p>In the ſecond part of the Chap. the Lord comforts the godly againſt the imminent and deſerved judgements, with ſome blenks of his mercy. And firſt, in this <hi>v.</hi> the mercy of God is held forth in coming over their provocations, to do any thing for them, and interpoſing to hold off the extremity of judgements deſerved by them; wherein, 1. It is inſinuate (by way of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for their Apoſtaſy) that their ſins deſerved hard things, even ſuch calamities as befell <hi>Sodom</hi> and the neighbouring Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of which See <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.23. But (2.) in the execution, the Lord was willing to make a ſtand, and not let it out. And here the Lord ſpeaks to our capacity, that as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greeved with the diſobedience of a ſon, is ready to avenge it ſharply, and yet out of fatherly affection repreſſeth his anger, and doth not let all of it out in execution; So the Lords bowels of compaſſion are ſuch, as not to execute his juſt wrath, as if he repented, and as men who repent uſe to do. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the viſible Church may be, and oft-times are ſo great both in themſelves and by reaſon of many aggravations of ingratitude and backſliding, as to deſerve utter extirpation, like <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> For, ſo is imported, that it was juſt <hi>to make them as Admah, and ſet them as Zeboim.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.48. It is but a needleſſe curioſity to enquire why he mentions theſe two Cities, and not <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and therefore I paſſe it. 2. Not only doth the Churches ſinne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:114928:115"/>
much; but it is no eaſie matter to hold off the extremity of execution, when after long forbearance ſin is ſtill continued in; For, ſo is imported here, that only ſtrong afflictions in God prevented the extremity of deſolation; They were at this brink of miſery, though they little conſidered it. 3. Whatever be the deſert and danger of the ſinfull people of God, yet no trouble can take effect againſt them, unleſſe God permit and let it out, and actively concurre in it; For, whatever their ſin was, yet they could not be plagued, till he <hi>give them up and deliver them,</hi> to the will and power of enemies; yea, till he <hi>make them as Admah, and ſet them as Zeboim.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.30. 4. When the Church hath put her ſelfe in a wofull plight by ſin, there is nothing to ſtep in and interpoſe for preventing what is deſerved, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mercy in God; For, there is no other impediment to this ſad ſentence, but <hi>how ſhall I give thee up, &amp;c? mine heart is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, &amp;c.</hi> And this he layeth before them, that at leaſt, they would ſtudy to ſee their need of mercy. 5. Mercy in God toward his ſinfull people, as it cannot be hindered by the greatneſſe of their ſin; So it can put a ſtop to deſerved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; For <hi>how ſhall I give thee up, &amp;c.</hi> Saith he, <hi>mine heart is turned within me, &amp;c.</hi> He can finde reaſons againſt his own proceeding in juſtice againſt them, taken from himſelfe, when they have nothing to plead, and there is no cauſe of it in them: And can argue that mercy is free, and goeth not by the rule of deſerving, and therefore may be extended to the moſt unworthy. And albeit it be an act of his ſovereignty in free-grace, thus to reſpect a people going on in ſin; and therefore ought not to be preſumptuouſly reſted on by the impenitent: Yet as that cannot hinder it to be ſhewed even to them; So it may be an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them who are driven ſenſibly to need his mercy. 6. The greatneſſe of Gods mercy toward his people, is ſuch as all the affections of parents toward their children, are but ſhadowes of it, and he who is the unchangeable God, will do all for them that can be expected from a parent, whoſe anger is overſwayed and changed into pity; For, ſo much do all theſe expreſſions point out, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up?</hi> doth import, that his fatherly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection could not think of putting <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they deſerved, and that he looked on it, as not beſeeming his love, and intereſt ſo to deal with them, <hi>mine heart is turned within me,</hi> (or overcome with motions of love ſtriving againſt that ſeverity) and <hi>my repentings are kindled together,</hi> (which are tearmes borrowed from among men) do import what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:114928:116"/>
of ſtirrings of love are in his heart toward his ill-deſerving people; and how all things that might prevent that ſentence, were kindled and muſtered up within him, that it might not come to execution and effect. 7. It is a ſpeciall evidence of Gods magnified mercy toward <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that whatever condition they be put in, yet they are never dealt with as <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> nor totally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, without hope of reſtitution or recovery; For, that is the ſcope of this whole <hi>v.</hi> which is further explained in the following purpoſe.</p>

                     <p>In the next place, the Lord comforts them by expreſſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, pointing out what this his mercy, which had interpoſed for their good, had purpoſed concerning them. The promiſes are two. In the firſt whereof (in this <hi>v.</hi>) he promiſeth to moderate that puniſhment, which he in juſt anger might inflict, and that he will not deale with them like an angry man, who after he hath ſtricken, returneth and ſtrikes again, till he deſtroy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them he is angry at: or as ſouldiers, who ſpoile and ſpoile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſo long as there is any thing to take; but he will deale like a mercifull conquerour, who having ſubdued his rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and brought them at under, doth not come with an army to deſtroy their c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ty; So he will plague them for ſin, and yet will not utterly deſtroy and cut off that Nation. This he confirmes from ſome reaſons. 1. Becauſe he is not an implacable man, but a mercifull unchangeable God. 2. He is in the midſt of them as his elect and choſen people, and holy in his promiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate the elect of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> throughout all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Gods mercy interpoſing on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of ſinners, doth produce not only good wiſhes, but reall effects unto them; For, here unto the former ſtirring of his bowels, an expreſſe promiſe is ſubjoyned, to ſhew that he not only (as is uſuall with men) pittied, and could not help them but that his pitty produceth reall help. 2. Gods mercy toward his ſinfull people doth not ſee it fit to keep off all effects of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, or leave them altogether unpuniſhed; For, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:114928:116"/>
is only, <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger,</hi> which imports he will execute it in meaſure. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.11. Albeit the Lord do pity them, yet it concerneth him to vindicate his own holineſſe, and to promote their good, by afflicting them in meaſure. 3. When a ſinful people are under ſaddeſt temporal judgements, yet ſo long as they are in the land of the living, they are bound to reckon that their condition might be yet worſe, if all Gods juſt diſpleaſure were let out: For, notwithſtanding all that was to come on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as we ſee it accompliſhed this day, yet it is imported it had been worſe, if he had <hi>executed the fierceneſſe of his anger,</hi> and <hi>returned</hi> (with ſtroak after ſtroak) <hi>to deſtroy Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>entered into the city.</hi> See <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.18, 21, 24, 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.12, 17, 21. 4. The Lords moderating of deſerved judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if it were but to preſerve a people from being utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, is a great proof of Gods mercy, and ought to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſuch; For, this is held out as a fruit of his kindled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings, <hi>I will not execute the fierceneſſe of mine anger, I will not return to deſtroy Ephraim, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22. That this may be well diſcerned, 1. We would not only ſee what we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, but conſider what we deſerve. 2. We would take up the dreadfulneſſe of the <hi>fierceneſſe of anger</hi> againſt ſin, and how much mercy it ſpeaks, and how it proves him to be God, that he doth ſet any bounds to it, and that he doth not purſue with ſtroak after ſtroak, till he ceaſe to be, but lets us ſubſiſt under our ſaddeſt condition. 3. Though we be readily imbittered under preſent troubles, and that we are not rid of them, even by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off when there is no other preſent iſſue; yet that is but our pride, and our caſe would appear otherwiſe, if we conſidered that preſervation may portend much future good to be laid up for a people, or for the Elect among them, as the Lord here manifeſts afterward. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. It is the great mercy and advantage of the Lords ſinful people, that they have to do with God, and not with man in their miſcarriages: For, mans pity and mercy may be exhauſted, were it never ſo great, but God is infinit; pitiful and merciful, men may for a time be ſo totally tranſported with anger, as to do that which afterward they will repent of; but he is the Lord, not ſubject to ſuch perturbations: Man may change, and his love turne into hatred; He is the Lord and changeth not: Man may think it diſhonourable to agree with, or ſpare an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, when he ſtoops not to him; God is ſo far above the creature, as he may when he will, think him below his indignation, and magnifie his mercy upon him: and man in his executing juſtice,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:114928:117"/>
is a creature, and bound to a Law which he may not tranſgreſſe; but God is Sovereigne, and hath mercy on whom he will: Upon theſe conſiderations it is that this is ſubjoyned as a reaſon of the promiſe, and ground of their encouragement, <hi>for I am God and not man.</hi> 6. The Lords relation to, and intereſt in a people, may ſtand unaltered, when yet he doth becauſe of ſin, ſmite them with ſore judgements, drive them into exile, and keep them long ſo under ſad diſtreſſe; For, ſo is held out to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all he was to do unto them, yet he ſtill is <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael</hi> (or, God of <hi>Iſrael) in the midſt of thee,</hi> as to the ſtanding of the Covenant-right, to be manifeſted in due time, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29. 7. God is ſo pure and holy, that not only his anger againſt his people is without all mixture of any thing that may be an imputation to him; but there ſhall be no cauſe of imputing to him any breach of promiſe, however he afflict, Therefore it is added, <hi>the Holy One of Iſrael,</hi> who can be charged with no blemiſh, and who hath given his Holineſſe as a pledge of the ſtability of his Covenant, even when he afflicts moſt ſharply, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.35.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond promiſe the Lord undertakes further, that not only he will not conſume <hi>Iſrael</hi> under their troubles; but that after their rejection and exile, he will convert them to follow him; that the Lord will declare himſelf ſo terrible, as none ſhall dare to hinder their return, and themſelves ſhall tremble to reſiſt the call of God, bidding them return, but ſhall go as affrighted ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and doves from all the places where they are ſcattered; And that God will place them not only in the Church, but (as would appear) in their land and houſes, to ſerve him in peace. And this is a promiſe to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or the ten Tribes, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lords preſerving of his people, how long ſoever reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſcattered, may at laſt end in much good to them; as this promiſe to <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſubjoyned to the former, doth teach. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God is the dawning of this fair day, and here his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:114928:117"/>
purpoſe of good begins openly to manifeſt it ſelf toward theſe whom he hath long preſerved; For, this is the firſt viſible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his mercy toward <hi>Iſrael, They ſhall walk after the LORD,</hi> or be converted. 3. Such as are truly converted, will take God for a teacher, to follow his directions; and for their captain, to be employed where-ever he commands, in doing or ſuffering; and he will be a guide and captaine to ſuch; For, ſo is their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion deſcribed. <hi>They ſhall walk after the LORD.</hi> 4. When a people turne to God, and follow after him, he will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf terrible to all who would ſtand in the way of their felicity; For, <hi>he ſhall roare like a lion,</hi> not only by the voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel working upon <hi>Iſraels</hi> hearts; but ſhall manifeſt himſelf to the terrour of the world, who will be alarmed by the converſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their appearing on the ſtage again. 5. The dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God ought to work even upon his converted people, to affright them from neglecting duty, and to make them tender-hearted before him; For, <hi>when he ſhall roare, the children ſhall tremble from the Weſt. They ſhall tremble as a bird, and as a dove,</hi> that is, the dreadfulneſſe of God ſhall not only make them with reverence flee to him, but ſhall make them afraid to ſit Gods call, inviting them to return, (as appears) to their land, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever difficulty there be in the way. 6. The Lord will not loſe his ſcattered people, and eſpecially <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but will ſeek them, and finde them to do them good, in whatſoever corner they are; For, <hi>from the Weſt, out of Egypt, and out of the land of Aſſyria,</hi> that is, in all quarters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will finde and bring them to reſtore them. 7.

                     <p>In this Verſe (which agreeth beſt with the beginning of Chap. 12.) we have the third part of the Chap. Wherein the Lord rejects <hi>Iſraels</hi> and their Rulers excuſes, whereby they thought to cover their faults in Religion and converſation. Theſe they made a pretence of before God, that they might prevent plagues,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:114928:118"/>
and they did caſt them up to the Prophets when they threatned; but the Lord declares them to be but falſe and deceitful preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And to aggreage their ſin, and vexe them the more, he commends <hi>Judah,</hi> at leaſt for having a lawful Kingdom in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> poſterity, wherein they ruled with Gods approbation: And that in the matter of preſcribed worſhip in Religion, they were faithful as became Saints, keeping the faith and Religion recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from their religious anceſtors, and keeping the true Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. This commendation is given to <hi>Judah,</hi> not only becauſe they ſtill clave to their lawful Magiſtrate, but even in the matters of Religion, though at ſome times they revolted in much, yet they were ſo <hi>yet,</hi> to wit, when <hi>Iſrael</hi> revolted, they had not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Religion, whatever were the failings of <hi>Solomon:</hi> See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.4,—12. and ſometimes thereafter they were ſo alſo, and in all the dayes of <hi>Hoſea</hi>'s Miniſtery, their Kings ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting <hi>Ahaz,</hi> were none of the worſt friends to Religion, and ſome of them zealous Reformers, in whoſe time it may be this was preached; yea, in the times of their foul defections, they for moſt part carried ſtill ſome reſpect to the Temple and Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever mercy the Lord manifeſt to be in his heart toward ſinners, yet that gives no warrant to them to pleaſe themſelves in ſin, or to think that the Lord takes leſſe notice of it, or abhorreth it the leſſe; To prevent this, the Lord returns to wonted challenges after the former promiſes. 2. Evil courſes in a land, ordinarily begin at the Rulers, and what they are, that the people do prove; For, what <hi>Ephraim</hi> is guilty of, that <hi>the houſe of Iſrael</hi> joyn in. 3. When men go furtheſt wrong, readily their courſes will not appear to themſelves in their worſt colours, nor will they let them be ſeen ſo to others, but will pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liate and cloak them over the beſt they may; For, it is charged upon them here, that they uſed <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>deceit,</hi> that is, falſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and excuſes, wherewith they thought to juſtifie their courſe. 4. Such pretences are dangerous plagues to men, and a cauſe of Gods controverſie; eſpecially when they dare preſent them to God, as ſuch as he will approve, and becauſe of them not plague their courſes, and when they hinder the Word from taking ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; For, it is a challenge, <hi>they compaſſe me about with lies,</hi> which may be underſtood, either as Gods ſpeech complaining that by theſe they would (as it were) beſiege and keep him in from plaguing of them; or the Prophets, whom they would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from uttering threatenings againſt a courſe which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to render ſo plauſible. 5. Whatever pretences men
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:114928:118"/>
betake themſelves unto; yet God doth ſee through them, and his Word will call them what they are; And he hath declared, that all pretences for juſtifying a ſinful courſe, are but mens deceiving of themſelves; and as they bear no weight before God, ſo they will diſappoint the ſinner in end; Therefore whatever they accounted theſe courſes to be, yet God by his Prophet pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them <hi>lies</hi> and <hi>deceit.</hi> 6. As it is the commendation of people to ſtand faſt when others do decline, (as here <hi>Judah</hi> is commended;) So it will be a great addition to a peoples ſin and ditty, when they go wrong, and yet are ſo far from being ſeduced by others, that they have a contrary example from them; For; this addes to <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, that they did all this, when <hi>Judah yet rules with God.</hi> 7. The holding up, and continuing of civil government according to Gods appointment, and the rules of his Word, is a commendable duty; and it is a peoples great <hi>ſin</hi> when it is otherwiſe; For, it is <hi>Judahs</hi> commendation, <hi>he ruleth with God,</hi> not only many of his Rulers act for God, (which is a preſage of good to a Land:) but the way of Government is lawful and approven, wherein <hi>Iſrael</hi> failed. 8. It is the duty of ſuch as do embrace the true Religion, to be in reality Saints, that they may reap the fruit of Religion, and adorne their profeſſion; For, it is the commendation of their progenitours, who tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the truth to <hi>Judah,</hi> that they were <hi>Saints.</hi> 9. Whatever may be the other failings of a people, yet it is matter of commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, to keep even external Religion pure, as it is tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from pious Anceſtors according to the Word; For, ſuch is <hi>Judahs</hi> commendation, <hi>he is faithful with the Saints,</hi> whereby <hi>Hoſea</hi> would not cover their other faults, which he elſewhere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth, and leaveth to be reprehended, eſpecially by their own Prophets; Only he ſheweth that this was commendable in it ſelf, and that in this they had out-ſtripped <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And when he ſaith, he <hi>is faithful with the Saints,</hi> his meaning is not to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie every thing as imitable, becauſe it is in a Saint, or Saints, as if their infirmities were all to be licked up: But his meaning is to ſhew that <hi>Judahs</hi> Religion, as it was in the firſt place ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the rule; ſo it was followed by their progenitours, and tranſmitted by them as ſuch: neither of which <hi>Iſrael</hi> could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for their way, though they gloried in their Progenitours, as much as <hi>Judah.</hi>

                     <p>In this Verſe the ten Tribes are challenged for their empty and vain hopes and ſhifts; and particularly, for their hunting after humane helps and confidences, and their making Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, and ſending preſents on every hand for that end. This the Lord pronounceth to be not only an unprofitable, but an hurtful
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:114928:119"/>
courſe: which he expreſſeth partly in borrowed tearms, of <hi>feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on winde,</hi> (an empty thing, which may fill, but cannot feed,) and <hi>following the Eaſt-winde,</hi> which was tempeſtuous and noiſome in theſe Countreys, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.6. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.8. and partly, in more proper tearmes, calling their courſes <hi>lies and deſolation. Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is no unuſual thing to ſee men abound in empty and falſe hopes, whereby they may (as they think) hold up their own hearts againſt wrath and the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Word; For, ſo doth <hi>Ephraims</hi> example teach. 2. Carnal confidence in humane helps and confederacies, is one maine hinderance of the words working upon people, and a prop to deluded and wicked men; For, ſuch was <hi>Ephraims</hi> hope in particular. 3. Men are naturally ſo averſe from God, that they will ſpare no paines or expence to keep them out of his reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and will turne them to all hands, to prevent any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeking to him; For, therefore doth <hi>Ephraim make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with the Aſſyrians,</hi> to his own great expence, a <hi>Kings</hi> 15.19. &amp; 17.3. and to ſecure himſelf yet more, <hi>oile</hi> (which was very excellent in <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.13.) <hi>is carried into Egypt,</hi> on the other hand, to buy their peace. And all this is, that he may ſecure himſelf without turning to God. 4. Upon due conſideration, men may finde that they have no leſſe pains by going out of Gods way, then if they had kept in it; but that Gods way, as it is undoubtedly the ſureſt, ſo in many reſpects it is even the eaſieſt courſe; For, when <hi>Ephraim</hi> goeth wrong, he muſt <hi>follow after,</hi> and earneſtly purſue his courſe; he muſt <hi>day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe,</hi> though it were but <hi>lies,</hi> and he muſt hire <hi>Egypts</hi> kindneſſe with <hi>oile,</hi> and the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> not without a preſent. Whereas turning to God, however it be altogether contrary to nature, yet it doth not impoſe ſuch bondage and toile upon men. 5. When men are given up to place their reſt in ſinful confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and carnal confidences, ordinarily they prove alſo perfidious in their pactions and Covenants; For, ſuch alſo was <hi>Ephraims</hi> way, <hi>They do make a covenant with the Aſſyrians,</hi> to be ſervants to them, as it is, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.3. and yet <hi>oile is carried into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> in a clandeſtine way, to borrow help in proving falſe to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> as is cleared, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. 6. Whatever carnall hopes men do reſt upon, yet they are but empty and deceitful, and will prove ſo, let men eſteem of them as they will; For, they are but <hi>winde</hi> and <hi>lies.</hi> That which is ſaid of Idols, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.20 will prove true of all ſuch confidences. 7. Such as would deceive God with faire ſhewes, and vain pretences, are
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:114928:120"/>
juſtly plagued with diſappointment in theſe courſes they chooſe unto themſelves; For, they who compaſſed the Lord, or his ſervants with lies, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.12. do now <hi>feed on winde,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe lies.</hi> 8. Carnal confidences will not only deceive men, but draw on more plagues, and be the occaſion and cauſe, if not alſo the mean of their ruine; For the <hi>winde</hi> proves the <hi>Eaſt-winde,</hi> and their <hi>lies, deſolation.</hi> And ſo it was verified, for not only did they impoveriſh themſelves with preſents and gifts; but the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were <hi>Ephraims</hi> ruine, and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> not only helped them not, but their ſeeking to them drew the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> upon their tops, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4, 5.</p>

And this the Lord refutes by this threatning. 2. Whatever God approve of in people, that is right, either in publick managing of affaires, or external way of Worſhip; yet he both ſeeth, and will puniſh the ſins of their converſation, which are not anſwerable to theſe; For, albeit <hi>Judah</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, <hi>ch.</hi> 11.12. yet becauſe of their failings in daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>The Lord hath alſo a controverſie with Judah.</hi> 3. The Lord is ſo impartial and tender, as that however every ſin deſerve ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treameſt judgements, and he will not ſpare any; yet he will mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure out his ſtroakes and diſpenſations according to the degree of peoples ſin, and their obſtinacy in it; For, <hi>he hath a controverſie</hi>

The Lord will not be deceived, nor ceaſe to proſecute a controverſie, becauſe of faire titles which men pretend to, when yet their wayes are not anſwerable; For, though they were <hi>Jacob,</hi> all whoſe children were of the bleſſed ſeed, (as it was not with <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi>) and therefore as good as <hi>Judah;</hi> yet <hi>the Lord will puniſh Jacob according to his wayes, according to his doings will he recompenſe him.</hi>

                     <p>Having mentioned <hi>Jacob</hi> in whom they gloried ſo much, he takes occaſion to relate what was <hi>Jacobs</hi> deportment and ſucceſſe; partly, that he might invite them to imitate him, in hope of like favours; and partly alſo, that it might be ſeen how juſtly he did accuſe and ſentence them, for being no way like to him, as appears from the reſt of the Chap. In this relation he points at three Hiſtories concerning <hi>Jacob;</hi> The firſt is that of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and birth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.22, 26. where in the very wombe, he took his brother by the heele, (whence alſo he got his name,) as ſtriving by a divine inſtinct, for the bleſſing. It imports, 1. A divine inſtinct and inclination put in <hi>Jacob</hi> in the very wombe, to ſtrive with his brother for the Birth-right and Bleſſing. And teacheth, 1. The favour of God and his grace are ſo far from being conferred according to mens merits and works; that the Lord not only chooſeth his own from eternity, and before they have done good or evil; but doth alſo ſometime prevent them with his ſanctifying grace in the very wombe; as here appeareth in <hi>Jacob.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.44. 2. It is a great bleſſing, and a double mercy, when the Lord not only conferreth grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſinner, but doth it timely, and makes them his from the wombe to the grave: as here he did to <hi>Jacob.</hi> This doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:114928:121"/>
much bitterneſſe for many ſlips before converſion, and for being (as it were) borne out of due time. 3. It is the commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able evidence of grace, when it ſtirs up men to labour, that none out-ſtrip them in deſiring ſpirituall bleſſings, For, it was about this that <hi>Jacob</hi> was moved by inſtinct, to contend with <hi>Eſau.</hi> 2. It imports, that however <hi>Jacob</hi> was not able by ſtrugling to prevent <hi>Eſau</hi>'s being the firſt-borne, and ſo likely to get the Birth-right and Bleſſing; yet this ſtrife in the very birth, preſaged, that in Gods purpoſe he was preferred, and that he ſhould be advanced to be the root out of which the Church and bleſſed Seed ſhould ſpring. And it teacheth further, 1. Where our endeavours fall ſhort, yet they are not to be given over, expecting that free-grace will make it up; For, <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtrives ſtill, even when <hi>Eſau</hi> is coming forth before him, as an evidence that grace would make up his diſadvantage. 2. As <hi>Jacob</hi> had his dignity and priviledges by gift; ſo it beſeemed his poſterity ill to boaſt of it, and abuſe it; And as grace beſtowed that on him after much wreſtling, ſo it was their duty not to reſt formally upon it, but to entertain it as he got it: So much would he teach <hi>Iſrael</hi> from this example of their Father <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond Hiſtory pointed at, is recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, being afraid of danger from his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> he wreſtled with God by prayers and teares, ſtriving for a bleſſing, and obtained it. It teacheth, 1. The choiceſt mercies of the people of God come oft-times unto them after ſad afflictions, wraſtlings and terrours; for, ſo doth <hi>Jacobs</hi> experience teach. 2. Difficulties, when they encounter us, would not be given way unto, but ſet againſt; for, ſo doth <hi>Jacobs</hi> practice teach, who fell a wraſtling when he was in danger. Diſcouragement and lying by, will ſerve for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but to make difficulties more inſupportable. 3. The beſt way of managing difficulties, is to ſee Gods hand in letting them out, and to begin at him, by wraſtling with him for his favour and bleſſing, as the compendious way to prevaile with men in what trials they may have a hand in; For, ſo did <hi>Jacob</hi> overcome all his difficulties by <hi>having power with God, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28. 4. God will give unto his weak ſervants ſtrength in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him, anſwerable to the task he puts upon them; yea, he who is Omnipotent and invincible, will condeſcend ſo farre, as to let them prevaile over him in his own ſtrength, when he ſeemes to reſiſt and be oppoſite unto them; For, <hi>by his ſtrength</hi> (to wit, which God had given him,) <hi>he had power with God,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:114928:121"/>
yea, he had power over the Angel, and prevailed.</hi> Gods appearing as a partie doth not portend a foile to the poor ſinner who wraſtles with him, though he be Omnipotent, and they weak. 5. God is therefore eaſie to be prevailed with, becauſe his people have not to do with God, ſimply conſidered in himſelf, and in his diſtance from the creature, but with God in the Mediatour Chriſt; For, it is <hi>with the Angel</hi> (or Meſſenger of the Covenant, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1.) who is alſo <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> had to do, and therefore <hi>had power, and prevailed.</hi> 6. Supplications and prayers are the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Ordinance with God in wraſtling; For, thus did <hi>Jacob</hi> prevaile, <hi>he made ſupplication unto him,</hi> and thus did Chriſt leave us a paterne, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. 7. Such as wreſtle with God by prayer, muſt have their heart broken and melted before God, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with their great need; For, it was <hi>Jacobs</hi> true magnanimity, that <hi>he wept and made ſupplication.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third Hiſtory, (wherein chiefly Gods mercy and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bounty toward <hi>Jacob,</hi> appeared) is, Gods appearing to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> at <hi>Bethel,</hi> firſt when he fled from his Fathers houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.11, 12, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and again after his trouble at <hi>Shechem, Gen.</hi> 35.1, 2, &amp;c. At both which times God manifeſted his minde to him in things concerning not only himſelf, but his poſterity, and namely, in making promiſes concerning the Church to come of him. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord will finde, and be found of his people, when they are little expecting it, as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.16. and when they are in great diſtreſſe, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was by reaſon of the ſlaughter of the <hi>Shechemites, Gen.</hi> 34.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. with 35.1. yea, and when they came to him after they have failed in duty, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their former vowes and obligations; as <hi>Jacob</hi> had forgotten his vowes made to God the firſt time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20, 21, 22. till upon occaſion of his diſtreſſe, God calls him to go again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.1. In theſe reſpects it is ſaid, <hi>he found him in Bethel,</hi> which may be underſtood both of God, who prevented <hi>Jacob</hi> by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt time, and with a call the ſecond time; and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who found God there, when he ſought unto him. 2. Gods comfortable interview and intercourſe with his people, is by his Word, wherein he is to be ſought and found; For, <hi>there he ſpake.</hi> 3. Gods manifeſtations and revealing of his minde of old, ſerves for the uſe of the Church in all ages; For, ſaith he, <hi>there he ſpake with us,</hi> as if they had been there preſent, becauſe what was ſpoken concerned them. This was eſpecially true in <hi>Jacobs</hi> caſe, to whom the promiſes were not perſonal only, but
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:114928:122"/>
chiefly for his poſterity. But it is alſo of general verity, that as the Church is much concerned in mercies and preſervation grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in former times, whereby they alſo are preſerved, who otherwiſe had not been; and therefore ought to rejoyce as one body with the Church, and as if they had been there, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 66.6. So the promiſes made to the Church of old, belong to the preſent Church, and particular perſons in their need, as if they had been firſt ſpoken to them, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.</p>

When the Lord makes offer of his favour, by declaring what he is, and what he hath been to others, it is our duty to make uſe of it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we would draw on more guilt: So much doth this inference from the former Doctrine, teach, <hi>Therefore turn thou.</hi> 2. Such as have made Apoſtaſie, would not only be convinced that it is ſo; but ought not to lie ſtill there, without thinking of recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; For, this direction, <hi>turne thou to God,</hi> inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuates they had made defection from what <hi>Jacob</hi> had attained, and that they ought to amend it. 3.

The Lord will not be deceived with ſhewes and flouriſhes of repentance, but requireth that by duties of the ſecond Table, both of mercy and juſtice, we ſhould prove the ſincerity thereof, and eſpecially by mercy in the firſt place; Therefore, it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, <hi>keep</hi> (or, carefully obſerve to do, and take opportunity of doing) <hi>mercy and judgement.</hi> See <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.7, 8. 5. Such as indeed turne to God from their Apoſtaſy, will be careful for the future, to walk in cloſe dependance and communion with God, to prevent the like defection; and as being diffident of their own ſtrength, to do it of themſelves; Therefore, it is alſo ſubjoyned as another evidence of their turning, <hi>wait on thy God continually.</hi> 6.

that though they were indeed turned to God, yet they would ſtill depend on God for influence to every good word and work; and having done all, yet they would not truſt on it, but ſtill wait on God. 7. Communion with God, and ſelf-denial, is evidenced and improven by much needy dependance and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on God, which hath ſtill hope in the boſome of it; For, <hi>wait thou on God,</hi> ſaith he. Waiting on God under ſeeming want, is a more real proof of communion keeping then many enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, whereon men would reſt, and it tends to much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment. And the word alſo ſignifies, <hi>hope in God,</hi> or <hi>expect God,</hi> becauſe a man by his waiting on, proveth that his hope is not quite cruſhed, though he diſcerne not that it is ſo, (for, if it were quite gone, he would wait no more, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33.) And whatever he think or feele, yet it is a clear proof that there is great ground of hope to one in ſuch a condition. 8. Intereſt in God would be laid hold upon for encouraging to dependance; And ſuch as cleave to him, and wait on him, do prove an intereſt, For, <hi>wait on thy God,</hi> ſaith he; If any cannot lay hold on this to begin their waiting, yet by waiting they prove it. 9. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God, and keeping communion with him, is a duty that admits of no Vacation or Tearm-day; Our beſt condition muſt not interrupt our needy dependance, and our ſaddeſt deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and rejections, do not warrant us to give it over; <hi>wait on thy God continually.</hi>

                     <p>The Lord having thus exhorted them, he proceeds in the reſt of the Chapter to ſhew how little theſe exhortations had taken, and how unlike <hi>Jacob</hi> they were, for all their glorying of him. This he doth in two articles of accuſation, to every one of which a ſentence is ſubjoyned. The firſt article hath two branches, whereof the firſt is, that <hi>Ephraim,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſuch a merchant, or follower of the world, as looked liker a <hi>Canaanite</hi> then an <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite,</hi> as did appear in his deceit in merchandizing, and his delight in violent oppreſſion. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The members of the viſible Church may ſo far degenerate, as whatever their titles and prerogatives, and their boaſting of them be; yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality they become as vile as the vileſt of the people, and God will ſo account of them; for, <hi>he is a Canaanite,</hi> (or, as it is in the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:114928:123"/>
Original, <hi>Canaan!</hi> by way of abrupt indignation,) The word uſually ſignifies <hi>a merchant,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were great traffickers, and inſinuating ſtonpers, (as the word imports,) that they might deceive; and ſuch merchants were they, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the ancient poſſeſſours of that land. See <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.7. 2. The love of riches is a great ſnare upon men, and drawes them on courſes contrary to their profeſſions and obligations, for, being <hi>a merchant,</hi> by covetouſneſſe in that calling, he became a <hi>Canaanite.</hi> See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. 3. Men are then exceſſive in the love of riches, when they will not wait on God, expecting his bleſſing on the lawful uſe of a lawful calling, but do uſe ſinful ſhifts; And particularly, when they dare uſe deceit in bargaining, and in weights and meaſures; for, in this he is a <hi>Canaanite, the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances of deceit are in his hand,</hi> that is, he perpetually ſtudieth to deceive, and not only likes it, but dares practiſe it. 4. Such as dare u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In theſe reſpects, <hi>deceit,</hi> and to <hi>oppreſſe</hi> are joyned together; and the ſame word ſignifieth both. 5. Love to ſin is a great aggravation of it, and it is horrid, when men not only deceive and oppreſſe out of love to wealth, (though as they pretend, unwillingly, if they could be rich otherwiſe,) but uſe of oppreſſion draweth to the love of it alſo, as well as of wealth by it; as accounting it their grandour to be terrible, or on the like conſiderations; Therefore it is added, <hi>he loveth to oppreſſe.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond branch of the accuſation holdeth forth <hi>Ephraims</hi> impudence, pleaſing himſelf in his deceit and oppreſſion, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Prophets ſaid againſt it, as being made rich, and full of ſubſtance thereby; As for that which followeth in the Verſ. it may be underſtood, 1. As an argument drawn from ſucceſſe, that ſince he was rich, therefore there was no iniquity in his way; or
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:114928:124"/>
that (as the word will read) there is <hi>no puniſhment of iniquity</hi> to prove that <hi>there was ſin</hi> in his labours, and therefore, why would they condemne what God countenanceth? And indeed, proſperity in ſinful wayes is an old ſnare, hindering men from heeding challenges, or Gods anger becauſe of them. 2. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his innocency with a profeſſion of deteſtation of ſin; <hi>They ſhall finde no iniquity, for that were a ſin,</hi> or, I abhorre it as a vile ſin. And indeed, ſome may be ſo groſſely hypocritical, as to pretend to great hatred of that, which they act with delight: and others, by going on in ſome ſins, may be drawn to act that which formerly they abhorred, and may be doing that upon the matter, and in practice, which they think they abhorre much in contemplation. Many would ſtartle much at the charge of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme, or denying of God, who yet in practice do ſo daily, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. But the word in the Original is not ſo emphatick, as to bottome this interpretation. Therefore I look upon it with the Tranſlation, as an extenuating of his fault, which was challenged, that however poſſibly in attaining to riches, he had uſed ſome fine and handſome trickes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances, yet the Prophets ſhould finde no groſſe iniquity, to be charged as expreſſe ſin, or that they needed to keep ſuch a ſtir about it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Wicked proſpering men ordinarily adde unto their oppreſſion and deceit, a glorying in themſelves, not acknowledging God in what they acquire; For, <hi>Ephraim ſaid, I am become rich, I have found out ſubſtance.</hi> 2. Gainful ſinnes are ſuch as men will not eaſily be convinced of, nor turn from, ſo long as they have carnal comforts to ſtop the mouth of conſcience, and to be a buckler againſt the importunities of Gods Servants; For, when they were challenged, <hi>Ephraim ſaid, Yet I am become rich,</hi> though they boaſt me with Gods diſpleaſure. 3. Wicked men their great eſtimation of riches, makes them very ſticking to what may acquire them, and to pleaſe themſelves therein, though it be ſinful; For, he accounted it <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>found out</hi> as a precious jewel, and with much paines; and therefore not to be ſleighted. 4. It is alſo another cauſe why men take not with chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges for the wayes of their acquiring wealth, that they look on theſe courſes as their calling and occupation, which therefore none ought to reprove, as if a lawful calling could juſtifie every miſcarriage in proſecuting of it; For, this is another pretext, it is <hi>my labours,</hi> the word ſignifieth toile unto wearineſſe, and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> thinks that his diligence in his calling, ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended. 5. Wicked men are ſo far from eying of God, or
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114928:124"/>
putting their own conſciences to it, to judge of their way, that if others cannot ſee nor accuſe them of a fault, they think they are well enough; For, ſo reckons <hi>Ephraim, they ſhall finde none ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, &amp;c.</hi> that is, the Prophets, and theſe who challenge them; which though it had been true, (as it was not,) had been but ſmall ground of peace, ſo long as God or their own conſcience might challenge them of ſin. 6. Handſome conveyances of ſin, by fineneſſe of wit, is a great ſnare to many, by concurring with other cauſes, to hide the ill of their way from them; For, ſo doth <hi>Ephraim</hi> ward off all challenges, <hi>they ſhall finde none iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that were ſin.</hi> 7. It is alſo a dangerous ſnare, and an evidence of a corrupt diſpoſition, when men make diſtinction of ſinnes, ſo as not to be troubled ſo long as they avoid what is more groſſe and palpable ſinful; For, ſo doth <hi>Ephraims</hi> apology inſinuate, that ſo long as they could <hi>finde none iniquity that were ſin,</hi> he would not be troubled for leſſer things.</p>

                     <p>Followeth the Lords ſentence for theſe ſins ſo defended, which is conveighed in the boſome of a promiſe of mercy to the godly; Wherein he declares that as of old he ſent them into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and did keep them in a wilderneſſe, after he had delivered them from thence; and yet gave them ſuch an iſſue at laſt, as was worthy of a yearly remembrance in the ſolemne feaſt of Tabernacle: So, ſince they had forgotten that mercy, he will again caſt them out of the land; and yet at laſt will gather and bring them back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and make their preſervation and reſtitution then, furniſh as much matter of joy as of old. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.14, 15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever be the miſcarriages of the Lords people toward him; yet he hath ſufficient evidence to plead for him, that he hath been good to them: And in particular, his dealing with them may abundantly refute their glorying in themſelves and condemn them for making ill purchaſe; For, whatever their way was, yet <hi>I am the LORD thy God, from the land of Egypt,</hi> ſaith he; and therefore it was a fault in them, to exalt themſelves as the authors of their proſperity, (as they do, <hi>v</hi> 8.) ſeeing it ſlowed all
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114928:125"/>
from his bounty, or his indulgence or long-ſuffering toward them; and it was a fault to take themſelves to ill ſhifts for purchaſing wealth, having to do with him who hitherto had proven ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. 2. Defended ſin, and particularly ill purchaſe, when men will not ſee the evil of it, ſhall be refuted by ſtroakes; and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away not only of ill purchaſe, but what they had beſide with Gods approbation: For, ſo much doth this threatening of exile, and caſting them out of the land, teach. 3. As Gods peculiar intereſt in his people, is the cauſe why he will not ſpare their faults, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. So he would not have ſaddeſt and juſtly deſerved ſtroaks looked on as his renouncing of his intereſt, but that he mindes to keep it ſtill; For, <hi>I that am the Lord thy God</hi> will do this, becauſe I am thy God; I will ſmite, and will be thy God though I ſtrike. 4. The longer God hath manifeſted an intereſt in a people, and the more gloriouſly he hath appeared for them, the more cauſe hath he to ſtrike when they ſin, and the more confirmations have they, that he will not caſt off when he ſtrikes: For, ſaith he, <hi>I am thy God from the land of Egypt,</hi> gloriouſly delivering thee from thence, and proving my ſelf thy God ſince that time. And therefore juſtly do I correct thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, when thou ſinneſt, and thou haſt ground to expect that I will not ceaſe to be thy God for all that. 5. Where God hath an intereſt in a people, his ſtroakes will be all dipped in love; and ought to be looked on as making way for, and ending in new proofes of love; For, ſaith he, <hi>I will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles,</hi> where he giveth them the firſt ſight of their exile and diſperſion, in a promiſe of making them keep feaſts in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their deliverance from it. 6. The Lord, when he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts his people, undertakes not only to give a ſweet iſſue from it, (which can be expected only from him;) but that he will ſatisfie them therewith, and cauſe them to rejoyce becauſe of it; For, <hi>I will make thee to dwell in Tabernacles,</hi> holds forth Gods under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to give the deliverance, and that they ſhould be ſatisfied and keep feaſts, or have joy like unto what they had during theſe typical feaſts. 7. God hath given ancient proofes of his love to his people, which as forgetfulneſſe of them, draweth on new trouble; ſo being in trouble, they give ground of confirmation of faith for what he further promiſeth: For, <hi>I will make thee to dwell as in the dayes of the ſolemne feaſts,</hi> imports not only that the former mercy now forgotten, behoved to be revived by a new mercy after a ſtroak, but that the one might be a pledge to the other.</p>

                     <p>Followeth the ſecond article of accuſation and challenge, which hath foure branches: Whereof the firſt is, their unfruitfulneſſe under the diſpenſation of the Word. The Lord who by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and by his kindeneſſe ſince, <hi>v.</hi> 9. had laid an obligation upon them to ſerve him; had alſo ſent Prophets to them, who frequently and clearly had revealed his minde, and what their duty was, to which they were obliged by his kindneſs: and yet (as is to be underſtood,) they remained ignorant and diſobedient. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Pains taken on a people by the Word, as it doth not alwayes prevaile with them; ſo it is ſo ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall a benefit, and doth ſo clearly hold out duty, as it draweth on great guilt, when uſe is not made of it: For, the ſcope of this challenge and aggravation of their ſin, from the clear light held out unto them, teacheth ſo much. 2. As it is God who ſpeaks by his Meſſengers, and who is either received or contemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in mens carriage toward them; ſo this will greatly heighten deſpiſers guilt: For, <hi>I have ſpoken by the Prophets,</hi> ſaith he, and yet have been ſleighted. 3. The eminency of Meſſengers im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and the excellency of their Meſſage, and of the way of their receiving it, doth yet further plead for God, and againſt deſpiſing ſinners: For, they were extraordinary <hi>Prophets,</hi> and rehearſed <hi>viſions,</hi> and what they received in an extraordinary way. And though the Church have not ſuch Meſſengers now, yet it may let us ſee their guilt who deſpiſe moſt eminent ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Meſſengers, who labour to ſtand in Gods Counſel, and to depend upon him, that they may finde out his minde in the Word, and bring it out with evidence and power to people; and it doth alſo witneſſe againſt them, who have the viſions of the ſame Prophets recorded in Holy Writing, and explained to them by ſuch ordinary Miniſters, and yet do deſpiſe them. 4. It is but a falſe pretence for men to reject the Meſſages of the Word, becauſe the Meſſengers are ordinary, and may erre; For, they who are of that temper, would uſe Prophets and Viſions no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as <hi>Iſraels</hi> carriage doth teach us. 5. The frequency and continuance of a Miniſtery, and Meſſages from God by them, as it argueth the Lords care and long-ſuffering toward a people;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:114928:126"/>
ſo it giveth them the more to reckon for: Therefore it is added, <hi>I have multiplied viſions.</hi> 6. As the Lord looketh to the manner, as well as to the matter of Preaching, and muſt be the enabler for both; ſo even the manner and plainneſſe of the way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will yet further condemne the diſobedient; For, it is a part of his praiſe in furniſhing his Prophets, and of their ditty, <hi>I uſed ſimilitudes,</hi> (which is a plain and familiar way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſenting divine things in ſome ſort, to the very ſenſes,) <hi>by the miniſtery of the Prophets.</hi>

But the Text runs better thus; Whereas they doubted if there could be any ſin in their worſhip in <hi>Gilead</hi> relative to the calves, it being masked with ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: Therefore the Lord declareth that all theſe were but vanity, and that both there, and in <hi>Gilgal,</hi> and elſewhere, their ſacrifices were but profane bullock-fleſh, and their many alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Idolatry and corrupt worſhip may be ſo busked up, as the practiſer of it will not readily ſee the ill of it; For, <hi>Is there iniquity in Gilead?</hi> ſay they, as not convinced of it; or the Lord by the Prophet, as challenging their conſcience for ſuch a profane thought. 2. It is one deceitful pretence of corrupt worſhip, when men ſet it up as a memorial of ſomewhat done by God for his people; and accordingly they chooſe either time or place, (as they have opportunity of either) wherein that was done to performe their worſhip in: For, therefore did they chooſe <hi>Gilead,</hi> where <hi>Jacob</hi> got a proof of love in his deliverance from <hi>Laban,, Gen.</hi> 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let men pretend what they will for palliating Idolatry and corrupt worſhip; yet in truth, and before God, their pretences are all but vain and deceitful, and will prove ſo: <hi>Surely,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>they are vanity.</hi> 4. Moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne adminiſtrations and ordinances, wanting an inſtitution, are but common things, and ſo much the baſer that they are ſo abuſed; For, <hi>they ſacrifice</hi> but <hi>bullocks,</hi> and they are ſo ſtill. 5. Idolatry and corrupt Religion will never ſatisfie the mindes and conſciences of men; as their endleſſe multiplying of theſe courſes, when they forſake the rule, witneſſeth; For, <hi>their altars are as heaps,</hi> or many of them. 6. Multitudes of Altars, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices will not render them the more acceptable, where an inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wanting: For, were <hi>their altars</hi> never ſo many, yet they are but <hi>as heaps in the furrowes of the fields,</hi> becauſe they had but one Temple, one Altar, and one Prieſt-hood appointed of GOD.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond branch of the accuſation, is a challenge for their vain gloriation in their Original, while they ſleighted the grace of God which exalted them. They looked on themſelves as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling all Nations for Nobility of kinde according to men, and to the fleſh, forgetting what root they did ſpring from: and that <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father being a ſtranger with his Fathers in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed land, was made to flee into <hi>Syria,</hi> and was there ſo poor, that he had no portion to pay for a wife, but ſold himſelf to be a ſhepherd to pay it. His poſterity likewiſe were but in a mean condition, being driven out of <hi>Canaan</hi> by famine; made ſlaves in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and delivered from thence, and preſerved in the wilderneſſe only by the Miniſtery of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who though a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, yet was not famous for carnal prerogatives, but a baniſhed man, and a ſhepherd in his exile. And by this alſo the Lord
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:114928:127"/>
would again ſet before them the carriage of their forefathers, which they did not imitate, and his great kindeneſſe in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, preſerving and advancing them, and that by the means of a Prophet, to aggreage their ingratitude toward him, and their contempt of preſent Prophets. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Scripture-Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and examples are recorded for our uſe, and they are profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably read, only when uſe is drawn from them: For, ſo doth the Lord hold out this Hiſtory of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not as a naked Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, but as containing challenges and documents for the preſent generation. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. 2. Albeit the Church, when ſhe is exalted by God, and honoured with great priviledges, do rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſwell with conceit, as if God could not get a people beſide her: Yet if ſhe keep her Original in minde, ſhe will ſee cauſe to glory in nothing but in grace alone; For, ſo much do theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples teach. 3. The Lord may lay them very low by afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom yet he will advance, and may traine them up under the rod, and prepare them for theſe intended mercies; For, ſo much did <hi>Jacob</hi> finde in his flight and hard ſervice, (when <hi>Eſau</hi> who had ſold his birth-right is proſpering,) and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the wilderneſſe. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16. 4. A good wife is one of the chief of mens external bleſſings, and a favour that cannot be dear bought; And it is the duty of wives ſo to carry themſelves, as they may not be eſteemed of only for the great por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they bring with them, (which they may ſoon miſſpend, and more with it,) but for their being a comfortable help to their husbands: So much is imported in the Law among ſome Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of paying dowry for a wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 34.12. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.25. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.14. which <hi>Jacob</hi> paid by hard ſervice, <hi>Iſrael ſerved for a wife, and for a wife he kept ſheep.</hi> 5. God by very ſmall means can deliver his people out of extream dangers, and can preſerve them (as they will need preſervation) after deliverance, that ſo they may glory in him only: For, <hi>by a Prophet</hi> (without any viſible power) <hi>the Lord brought Iſrael out of Egypt, and by a Prophet was he preſerved.</hi> 6 Whatever eſtimation ſecure and profane men may have of a Miniſtery, yet they are Gods notable inſtruments for the good of his Church, as they alwayes finde in a day of diſtreſſe: For, by mentioning <hi>a Prophet,</hi> as the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance and preſervation, he doth upbraid their ſleighting of Prophets now, though of old they had ſtood them in ſo great ſtead.</p>

                     <p>The laſt branch of the accuſation, and the ſumme of all the reſt, is, that by their ſinful ingratitude, and their own inventions, they provoked God grievouſly, and as it were, of ſet purpoſe. To all which is ſubjoyned the Lords ſentence, that he will give them up to reap the fruit of their bloody crimes, whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only ſhould bear the blame; And that he will caſt on their own faces the fruit of that reproach and diſhonour which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to do to God by their ſins. All which he will do according to his right of dominion over them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Gods people cannot prove that he takes up a controverſie needleſſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but he is only angry when they put him to it by their ſin: For, <hi>Ephraim</hi> (who miſled all the reſt) <hi>provoked him to anger.</hi> 2. As all ſin floweth from a bitter root, and doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to let the ſinner feel it bitter in end; ſo the provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his people is moſt bitter, eſpecially when they forſake him, and embrace idols, and when they carry themſelves ingrately to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, and yet will pretend to an intereſt in him: For, it was by theſe and the like ſins that <hi>Ephraim provoked him to anger moſt bitterly,</hi> where he ſpeaks after the manner of men who are imbittered by undutiful and groſſe miſcarriages toward them; and it imports that their provocations were intolerable, and that they ſhould finde by the bitter fruits of them, how much he is provoked. 3. God needs no more for taking courſe with men, but leave them to their own guilt, to reap as it deſerveth; And it is a ſad judgement, when our guilt (and not Gods mercy) gets the meaſuring out of ſtroaks; For, it is his ſad ſentence, <hi>therefore ſhall he leave his blood upon him,</hi> that is, God will leave him under the guilt and power of his bloody crimes, and cruel ſinnes againſt the ſecond Table, that they may draw vengeance upon him. 4. When God threatens and ſtrikes his ſinfull people, he is innocent of their ruine, and onely ſinne is to be blamed: For, <hi>he ſhall leave his blood upon him,</hi> may import alſo, that his blood and deſtruction for theſe bloody crimes, was upon his owne head, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:114928:128"/>
not to be charged on God. 5. Wicked men within the Church, do by their miſcarriage, reproach and raiſe an ill report upon God, as if he were not an all-ſufficient God worthy to be ſerved, as if he ſhould be guided by them in the matter of duty and Religious performances; and accept what they offer, and not what himſelf commands; and as if he were a liker and approver of their ſinne, becauſe he continues his favour toward ſuch: And all this they do, beſide the reproach caſt upon God by the Heathen, becauſe of their miſcarriages: For, there is <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> to be <hi>returned,</hi> which conſequently imports, they had caſt it upon him. 6. A reproached Lord will vindicate his own glory, by cauſing all the reproachful effects of ſin to return upon the ſinner: For, <hi>his reproach ſhall his Lord return unto him.</hi> 7. When God is provoked to anger, neither a real nor pretended intereſt will hold off ſtroakes; And albeit preſumptuous ſinners do reject God, his authority and yoke; yet he will exerciſe dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them whether they will or not: For, ſaith he, <hi>his Lord ſhall returne it upon him,</hi> whereby he ſheweth that no intereſt will avail to plead for exemption; and particularly, that his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he chooſeth, he will let them finde that he chooſed them on theſe tearmes, to be Lord over them, (as the Name here is a Name of dominion,) and will prove it to be ſo when they ſinne.</p>

That by the Idolatry of <hi>Baal,</hi> they were deſpoiled of authority, and their State broken, <hi>v.</hi> 1. 2.

He would prove a King to them, when their Kings and Princes, whom they ſinfully ſought, and whom he had given in anger, were to be cut off in his diſpleaſure, <hi>v.</hi> 10, 11. 2. When he ſhould reckon with them for their treaſured up and marked iniquities, and they ſhould be brought into greater extremity, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13. yet he would at laſt raiſe them up as it were out of their graves, <hi>v.</hi> 14.

                     <p>In the firſt part of this Chap. the Lord demonſtrates that their own ſins had procured all the deſolation that had come, or ſhould come upon them, and that he had been good unto them, till they by their ſins had overturned their own good eſtate. The firſt ſin which he mentions as deſtroying them, is their Idolatry in worſhipping <hi>Baal;</hi> Concerning which the Lord cleareth for his part, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> was not only made a diſtinct tribe (though he was but the ſon of one of the twelve Patriarchs who had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at leaſt beſide him) and preferred to <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> the elder brother; but was ſo dignified, numerous and potent, that he was formidable to the reſt, (as appeared in the perſon of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who came of that tribe, <hi>Joſh</hi> 4.14. and in the whole tribe, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.1, 2.) Yea, and that tribe was exalted to authority in <hi>Iſrael, Jeroboam</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being come of it; So that they had great authority above the reſt. But now having brought in the pagan Idolatry of <hi>Baal</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Ahab, Ephraim</hi> was become like a dead man, deſpoiled of authority, many of his ſubjects cut off, and ſo broken in his former eſtate and dignity, that he is not far from utter ruine, though yet he be as one unburi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He mentions only the Idolatry of <hi>Baal</hi> as the cauſe of this ruine, becauſe however they had the golden calves before, and theſe tended to their deſtruction; yet it was the cape-ſtone of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, when beſide theſe (in ſerving of which they pretended ſome acknowledgement of the true God) they brought in pagan Idols, renouncing him. And after this they began to decay by the invaſion of forreigners, having, for moſt part, had to do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with <hi>Judah</hi> before. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As honour and reſpect is due to ſuperiours; So their power and authoritie over ſubjects is of God, and to be held of him; For, ſo is here imported, that God made <hi>trembling</hi> or reverence, <hi>when Ephraim ſpake,</hi> or gave out his commands. See <hi>Pſa.</hi> 18 47. 2. Such as God hath made very eminent may yet go very far wrong; yea, and greatneſſe may em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden men to ſin; For, it was <hi>Ephraim,</hi> who <hi>when he ſpake,</hi> made <hi>trembling,</hi> and who <hi>exalted himſelfe in Iſrael<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> or was ſet in high dignity, that offended even <hi>in Baal.</hi> 3. When men do thus decline, and abuſe Gods bounty toward them, his kindneſſe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:114928:129"/>
will ſtand as a witneſſe againſt them; For, therefore is <hi>Ephraims</hi> former dignity recorded, to witneſſe againſt their way, and to cleare that God was free of the conſequences of it. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.19, 20. 4. Sin will undoubtedly blaſt the eminency, either of perſons or Nations, and will lay them low in their repute, eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and power, and make them like a dead carcaſe above ground; For, even glorious <hi>Ephraim, when he offended, he died,</hi> that is, he looked no more like what he was before, then a dead man hath the activity and vigour of one that is living. 5. Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and corrupting of Religion, is, above all ſins, a cauſe of corruption and decay to States and Nations; For, <hi>when he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends in Baal, he died.</hi> 6. Albeit God be angry at all ſorts of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, yet he is more eſpecially provoked, when a people do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together renounce him, and chooſe an Idol in his place, for the object of their worſhip; And when men will not repent for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Idolatry, they are juſtly given up to this groſſe defection, to put the certainty of their deſtruction out of all controverſie; For, whatever <hi>Iſrael</hi> thought of their calves, and whatever was Gods controverſie againſt them, for them; yet now <hi>when he offends in Baal,</hi> it is undeniably juſt that <hi>he died,</hi> as being under an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable defection.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The ſecond ſin that deſtroyed them, is their Idolatry, in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping Images and calves notwithſtanding this decay of their State, and Gods preſerving of them yet from utter deſtruction. For albeit <hi>Jehu</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Baal</hi> and his worſhippers, and God did in ſome meaſure uphold the State of the Kingdome under his poſterity; yet the golden calves were ſtill adhered unto; yea, they grew worſe in following that ſin, and multiplied Images ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own pleaſure and fancy. And the Rulers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and the people encouraged one another to kiſſe the calves, as a certain ſigne of reverence performed to them. This multiplying of Images more and more, points at the growing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114928:130"/>
ſuperſtition of the people, who albeit at firſt they had the calves only at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet afterward they not only chooſed <hi>Gilgal, Gilead</hi> and <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> (as is before marked,) to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſolemn worſhip; but they multiplied little images and calves, (as well as altars, <hi>chap.</hi> 8.11. and 12.11.) for their private devotions at home. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Idolatry is a ſinne not ſoon abandoned, eſpecially where it ſeemeth to ſerve and uphold an intereſt; for, therefore do they ſtill cleave to the <hi>calves</hi> and their <hi>images,</hi> when <hi>Baal</hi> is put down. 2. Idolatry may in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time become univerſal, and a peoples choice who were not ſo willing to it before; for, <hi>they,</hi> that is, all the people with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> do this. 3. Impenitencie after corrections, and Gods moderating of them doth highly aggravate ſin; for now, after they are in a manner dead, and yet God hath kept them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quite taken away from off the earth, <hi>they ſin.</hi> 4. Leſſer ſins, for which God will not deſtroy a people till they grow worſe, will be grievous and hainous, when continued in after correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for, albeit <hi>Ephraim</hi> at firſt died not till he ſinned in <hi>Baal,</hi> yet now their <hi>images</hi> and <hi>idols,</hi> (which is underſtood of the calves, as appeareth from the end of the verſe) become a land-deſtroying ſin. 5. Whatever it be that men pretend to repreſent by their images as the object of their worſhip, yet images are i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols in themſelves, and do not repreſent the true God, (as their worſhippers pretend and give it out) but an idol fancied by the deviſer, and will prove matter of ſorrow and terrour in the end; for, <hi>their molten images</hi> are <hi>idols,</hi> and do repreſent or bring to remembrance no other thing, however they pretended to make them in remembrance of the Lord who brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.28. and the ſame word that is rendered <hi>idols,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>terrours</hi> alſo, becauſe they prove ſo in end. 6. Such as are not reclaimed from idolatry by corrections, but do perſevere in it, will readily grow worſe and worſe; for, <hi>now they ſin more and more.</hi> Not only do they bewray more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and maliciouſneſſe in following that ſin, which before might be masked with a pretence of ignorance and infirmity; but they multiplie that ſin, <hi>and have made them molten images,</hi> beſides what they had before. 7. It will alſo aggreage the ſin of idolatry, that they are ſo hot upon it as they will ſpare no expence to promove it; for, <hi>they made them molten images of their ſilver,</hi> and were laviſh enough that way. 8. Mens leaning to their own skill and prudence, rejecting Gods counſel and revealed will, is the falſe principle and rule that begins and carries on all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114928:130"/>
corruption in Religign; for, <hi>they made idols according to their own underſtanding.</hi> They followed their own fancie and skill in making and multiplying of them to further their devotion, as they thought. 9. It doth bewray the brutiſhneſſe of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they do worſhip theſe things, whereupon themſelves, or others inferiour to them, confer all the excellencie they have; for, <hi>all of it is the work of the Craftſmen.</hi> Mean artificers do put the ſtately ſhape upon their idols; and yet they do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them. 10. Commands of authority do not take away the ſinfulneſſe of idolatry, but it doth rather adde unto it, that ſuch iniquity ſhould poſſeſſe the throne; for, this challenge, that <hi>they ſay of them, Let the men that ſacrifice, &amp;c.</hi> may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of their Rulers enjoyning this ſigne of reverence, when men came to offer ſacrifice; See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.20. 11. Mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen avowing of idolatry within the viſible Church, and their encouraging of one another to it, doth yet make it more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before the Lord; for, this alſo may be underſtood of the peoples mutual up-ſtirring one of another to performe this, as an addition to the ſin. And this may very well conſiſt with the former, that as their Rulers gave out a wicked command, ſo the people yielded prompt and ready obedience, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one another in it. 12. God doth not judge of idolatry on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by conſidering mens intentions and heart in what thay do; but there is an external idolatry which he abhors alſo, when a religious act of worſhip is performed immediately, to ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſet up in a religious State, however the worſhipper pretend to direct it by that mean unto God; for, here he condemnes <hi>kiſſing of the calves,</hi> (which was a ſigne of reverence, either when they kiſſed the object it ſelf, or brought their hand to their mouth and kiſſed it, in token of religious obſervance, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. <hi>Job</hi> 31.27.) as an idolatrous act, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their intentions were.</p>

ſmoke. Whereby is pointed out that they ſhould be driven out of their land and conſumed, till they ſhould (in a manner) come to nothing. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Where ſtroaks inflicted do not amend a people, the Lord hath yet more to let out, even till they be utterly conſumed; for, beſide all that had been inflicted, <hi>v.</hi> 1. he hath yet more here. 2. Nothing will be able to ſtand out againſt an angry God; all that the creature can oppoſe may be compared to fraileſt things; yea, and many ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes are little enough to point out this frailty; for, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are all theſe ſimilitudes borrowed from evaniſhing things, gathered together to point out what they ſhould prove. 3. Great appearances and ſhewes of a flouriſhing condition, will not guard againſt Gods hand; for, ſo much alſo do theſe ſimilitudes teach, a great cloud over-ſpreading the skie, and abundance of dew watering the earth, ſeem to promiſe much, but they ſoon paſſe away before the Sun, chaſte lying ſecure among grain, is ſoon driven by a whirlwinde, and great heaps of ſmoke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a chimney, do ſoon ſcatter and evaniſh; and ſo ſhould their condition prove. 4. Judgements on impenitent ſinners; will come ſwiftly and violently, and will bring utter deſolation; ſo much further do theſe ſimilitudes teach; the cloud and dew is ſwiftly gone, the whirlewinde violently drives the chaffe, and all of theſe do utterly evaniſh.</p>

                     <p>The third deſtroying ſin, (and an aggravation of the ſin of their idolatry, as appears from the way it cometh in, <hi>Yet I am the Lord, &amp;c.</hi>) is, their ingratitude.

What deſtruction this drew on, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. As to the firſt, the Lord declareth that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever now they had choſen their idol-calves; yet before ever they knew them he had been good to them, and better then they had found their idols ſince; for in their deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> he had proved himſelf their God by many ſignes and wonders;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114928:131"/>
yea, that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> was after that deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſolemnly renewed with them as a Nation, wherein he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and obliged them to their duty, and to the true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by cloſing with him, who only could prove a God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to them, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and to confirme them in this, he did ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly own them for his people, providing for them in the wilderneſſe, where their meat could be furniſhed only by miracle, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever courſe the declining people of God follow, yet upon due trial they will finde, that never courſe thrave with them ſo well as Gods way; for, ſo much doth this rehearſing of ancient kindneſſe, being laid in the balance with their preſent condition, teach. 2. The greateſt of bleſſings that can be conferred on a people, is to be owned as Gods peculiar people in Covenant with him: for, this is the fountain of all, <hi>I am the Lord thy God.</hi> 3. When God is confederate with a people, he will prevent them in their low eſtate, and will prove his intereſt by deeds, as their need requireth. for, <hi>I am thy God from the land of Egypt,</hi> not only ſince that time, but then in a remarkable manner, when he reſpected them in their bondage, and by a glorious deliverance proved that he was their God. 4. God who is confederate with his people, will alſo renew his Covenant when they have forgotten it, and fore-faulted their right to it; for, his being their God <hi>from the land of Egypt,</hi> doth alſo point at the renewing of the Covenant on Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſhortly after they came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was Gods great mercy, conſidering what they had been in <hi>Egypt, Ezek.</hi> 20.7, 8. 5. When mercies are manifeſted, and a Covenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with a people, it layeth many obligations to duty upon them, and they need many inſtructions how to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in relation to ſuch diſpenſations; for, this part of the verſe, <hi>And thou ſhalt know no God but me,</hi> is not only a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that eſſay whom they would, they ſhould finde none to prove a God unto them, but he: but it relates chiefly to the inſtructions given them upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and to the Law publiſhed with the Covenant, the firſt command whereof is the ſame with what is here. 6. The great duty that lieth on a confederate people, and theſe who have reaped the fruits of Gods bounty, is to be engaged to God as the only true God, their only delight, and refuge in all neceſſities, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to the true Religion wherein his Name is profeſſed and acknowledged; for, this is the ſumme of that direction, <hi>Thou ſhalt know no God but me,</hi> or acknowledge none but him; See,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114928:132"/>
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.8, 9, 10. 7. God doth not ſeek a people to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him, becauſe he needeth them, but becauſe they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do ſo well; they will finde no God but him, and they will finde him delighting to be a Saviour; which none elſe can do, nor any thing without him; for, ſo much is imported in this reaſon of the direction, to acknowledge none but him; for, <hi>there is no Saviour beſide me.</hi> 8. When God hath entered in Covenant with his people, he will prove his all-ſufficiency, and engage them yet more to be his, by his conſtant care of them in their progreſſe; for, ſo did he engage them in the wilderneſſe, after he had entered in Covenant with them; <hi>I did know thee in the wilderneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> 9. Mercies are therefore ſweet (how common ſoever) to the Lords people, becauſe they come to them by ſpecial providence, and are an evidence of his owning them as his; and this doubleth the obligation on theſe who are ſo dealt with; for, it is the ſweet and obliging ſight he giveth them of his dealing in the wilderneſſe, <hi>I did know thee,</hi> or take ſpecial care of thee as my people. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.7. 10. Gods care and providence is moſt conſpicuous to his people, in their ſtraits and wanting condition, that ſo mercies received at ſuch a time may be yet more obliging; for, ſo is declared here, <hi>I did know thee in the wilderneſſe, in the land of great drought;</hi> where not ſo much as a drink of water could be had but by miracle</p>

                     <p>In the third place we have the deſtruction which this ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude drew upon them from God, to wit, that his dreadful vengeance, and all his creatures ſhould be armed againſt them utterly to conſume them.

Ingratitude and proud forgetfulneſſe of God, do draw on violent, mortal and deadly ſtroaks of deſtruction; for, he will becauſe of theſe ſins <hi>rent the caule of their heart,</hi> (after which a man cannot live) <hi>and devoure them there,</hi> (that is, preſently after he hath killed them) or ſwallowed them up, as a beaſt doth his prey; ſo that they ſhall not be to be found as a Nation. 2. All the dreadfulneſſe of the creatures put together, is but a ſhadow and reſemblance of the fierce anger of God againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible ſinners; for, look what is in <hi>a Lion, a Leopard, and a Beare</hi> and it is all here, and much more. 3. It is one ſad fruit of ſin, and making God an enemy, that he will, as it were, lie in wait to take all advantages of ſinners to undo them, which is not
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:114928:133"/>
only ſad, that he who watcheth over his people for good, ſhould be provoked thus to do, but he will ſoon reach the creature, when he thus lets out his diſpleaſure; therefore, ſaith he, <hi>as a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard by the way,</hi> (as they uſe to do, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>will I obſerve them,</hi> to wit, that I may take all advantages againſt them to deſtroy them. Hence it is that an angry God can inflict a curſe upon ſinners in every ſtep of their life, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.16, 17, 18, 19. 4.

The wrath of God can arme all creatures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinners, and make men cruel like heaſts in executing his vengeance; for, <hi>the wilde beaſt ſhall teare them,</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, both that enemies ſhould be beaſtly cruel againſt them, and that even wilde beaſts ſhould be let looſe upon them, either in their own land, or when they were going from thence into exile.</p>

And this doth prove, that however they had undone themſelves, yet he would help them. The firſt proof and evidence hereof is in theſe verſes, wherein he promiſeth, that when their Kings and Princes, (whom they ſinfully ſought, and whom God gave in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and had and would take away in diſpleaſure) ſhould be gone and unable to ſave them ſo much as in any one city, yet then he would prove himſelf a King and Helper. This that is related here hath indeed ſome alluſion to that of the peoples ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5, 19, 20. When God gave them <hi>Saul,</hi> who was afterward cut off: wherein yet the fault was not ſimply in deſiring a King, ſince they had a warrant to expect a King, from <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.14, 15. but that they waited not on God, but preſcribed the time and manner to him. But ſeeing this matter was afterward ſetled in the Lords chooſing of <hi>David</hi> and his race: and the Lord is now only ſpeaking to the ten tribes; therefore it ſeemeth rather to point at <hi>Iſraels</hi> defection from <hi>Davids</hi> race, and their getting Kings in anger, which were (for moſt part, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the laſt of them) cut off for a judgement on that people. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men may ſin very hainouſly againſt God in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of change of Civil Government, when his preſcribed rule is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:114928:134"/>
not followed; for, ſo did <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they ſaid, <hi>Give me a King and Princes,</hi> or let me have a State of my own, rejecting <hi>Davids</hi> poſterity. 2. When men are following their wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, God may in his holy providence and permiſſion let it ſucceed with them, and may ſeem to ſecond them in it, though without all imputation to his holineſſe; for, <hi>I gave thee a King,</hi> to wit, when he did intimate his purpoſe concerning <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and let them ſucceed in their courſe of defection, yet no way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of it. 3. Men may get their will in much wrath, and particularly, God can let out much of his diſpleaſure in giving of Rulers to a people; for, <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger.</hi> 4. When men once are out of Gods way, they will meet with wrath in every condition, whether they have or want their Will; for, <hi>I gave thee a King in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.</hi> It was wrath ſtill whether they had or wanted him. 5. A way which is accurſed in the beginning, will be yet more accurſed in its end, for there was <hi>anger</hi> in giving a King at firſt, but <hi>wrath</hi> or hot diſpleaſure <hi>in taking him away;</hi> Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe the removal of one, did but make way for a worſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour: and partly, becauſe the cutting off of many of them was accompanied with the ruine of many of the people: and the Nation was cut off with the fall of the laſt King. 6. All the courſes and carnal policies that men can follow, will not avail them in the leaſt againſt Gods diſpleaſure; for, though they ſought <hi>a King and Princes,</hi> that they might be a ſtately Monarchie, yet <hi>where is there any other that may ſave thee in all thy Cities?</hi> they could finde none any where that might ſo much as help in one City. 7. When all refuges have failed the Lords ſinful people, yet he remains able and willing to ſupply what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means cannot, and will take advantage to do for them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no other to do for them; for, <hi>I will be thy King,</hi> or, <hi>I will be,</hi> to wit, unchangeably ſtill the ſame, and the help as I have been, <hi>Where is thy King that may ſave thee?</hi> ſeeing there is no other help, therefore he will appear.</p>

Albeit a people may continue long ſinning, and God in the mean time forbear them, yet their ſin is but growing and heaping up to a day of vengeance; for, <hi>the iniquity of Ephraim is bound up: his ſin is hid,</hi> like a thing that is ſafely laid up out of the way, that it be not loſt. See, <hi>Job</hi> 14.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4 2. The Lords long-ſuffering and patience toward impenitent ſinners, will at laſt break forth in ſudden and extreme ſorrow; for, <hi>the ſorrowes of a travelling woman ſhall come upon him:</hi> and theſe are both ſharp and ſudden. 3. The greateſt extremity of trouble upon the Lords people, is travelling with mercy to them, if they by repentance would labour to bring forth that birth; for, it is <hi>the ſorrows of a travelling woman,</hi> and there is a birth, if they would endeavour to make it break forth. 4. It is an uſual plague upon impenitent ſinners, that they lie ſtupid under judgements, not beſtirring themſelves to get the uſe and iſſue of them, by converſion unto God; for, it is ſuppoſed <hi>he ſtayes long in the place of the breaking forth of children,</hi> like a childe that ſticks in the very birth, and doth not ſtruggle and move for its own relief. 5. Stupidity under judgements is a great evidence of madneſſe and folly, and a very deadly token, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of an hopeleſſe condition in it ſelfe; for, <hi>he is an unwiſe ſon,</hi> who doth this, and it is like the <hi>ſtaying long in the place of breaking forth, &amp;c.</hi> which is a deadly token both to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and childe, and ſo their ſtupidity proved to them, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate in the following promiſe.</p>

                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:114928:135"/>Gods helping of them in thir extremity, is held forth in a promiſe of delivering them, when they ſhall be as men dead and in their graves: and of his triumphing over death and the grave, to the utter undoing of their power; of which purpoſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them he declareth that he will never repent: This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, (together with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8.) is applied to Chriſts giving a compleat and full victory to his people at the reſurrection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.54, 55. Partly, becauſe this deliverance is a notable pledge of that; and partly, becauſe that ſpiritual promiſe is included here, to be performed (as well as the other) to penitent <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who flee to Chriſt for reconciliation and ſalvation, as many of them will do, when the Lord ſhall open their graves, and bring them out to embrace the Goſpel. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The troubles that come upon Gods people for ſin, may bring them ſo low, as to make them like dead men lying in their graves; for, ſo is imported here, that they are under <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>the power of the grave;</hi> See, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 57.11. all this is but little to the full deſert of ſin, if God ſhould purſue it in ſtrict juſtice, and even the Lords people may be driven to this, before they be put from their carnal confidences to draw to God. 2. A peoples being dead and buried under calamities, is neither an argument that God will not help them, nor any impediment to his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to do for them, but they may be as near help then, as when their trouble is leſſe; for, <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death.</hi> See, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 37.22. <hi>John</hi> 11.25, 40. 3. The Lords mercies and deliverances granted to the viſible Church, do flow from a purchaſe, made of the Elect among them, and ſo theſe mercies come to them, and to the viſible Church for their ſake; for, ſo much is imported in that he will <hi>ranſome</hi> and <hi>redeem them from the grave and death,</hi> that is, becauſe a real ranſome is paid to divine juſtice for the elect among them, and becauſe he hath a purpoſe to give unto theſe a compleat victory over death at laſt; therefore he redeems or delivers all of them from their deadly difficulties, that they may participate of the means which do promove theſe ſpiritual ends. Compare. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.10. 4. The Lord will not only preſerve a people in whom he hath intereſt, under trouble; or ſimply give them deliverance from it, but will deliver them by the utter deſtruction of the means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of their trouble, if it were even death and the grave; for, <hi>O death, I will be thy plagues, O grave, I will be thy deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> imports ſo much, as it relates to <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance, that
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:114928:135"/>
God will deſtroy all that may ſtand in the way of it. 5. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deliverances are then ſweet, when with them men by fleeing to Chriſt, have aſſurance of ſpiritual and eternal mercies alſo; for, ſo much doth this promiſe in its full extent import, that not only the Nation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be delivered from their deadly calamities, but the Elect among them ſhould at laſt be raiſed up to enjoy eternal ſalvation. 6. It is the ſpecial comfort of ſuch as flee to Chriſt, that they will at laſt ſolidly triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all their enemies. And particularly, this death and the grave will be ſo deſtroyed at their reſurrection, as they ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſting nor victory over them; for, ſo much doth this promiſe concerning the grave and death, (which is the laſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26.) as it is held out here, and explained, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. teach us. 7. The mercies which were ſhewed of old unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and more particularly to be fulfilled at their Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are not able evidences and pledges of Gods power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what he hath promiſed to perform to his own at the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; therefore are both held out in one promiſe, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a pledge of the other: for, their Converſion will be as <hi>life from the dead,</hi> not only to themſelves, but to the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. which will notably confirme faith, and the hope of a future reſurrection. 8. As Gods purpoſes of mercy toward his Elect are immutable and unchangeable: ſo alſo are his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes concerning the raiſing up and Converſion of <hi>Iſrael</hi> as a Nation; therefore is it ſubjoyned to this promiſe concerning them; <hi>repentance ſhall be hid from mine eyes;</hi> that is, not only will he plague death without pity, but generally he will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent nor change this purpoſe of raiſing them up. See, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29.</p>

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:114928:136"/>
make up another ample proof of that aſſertion, <hi>v.</hi> 9. This aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is held forth, firſt in a threatening againſt <hi>Ephraim,</hi> (whoſe name is alluded unto here) who is threatened here in borrowed termes, that however both for number, power and riches, he was above other tribes; yet God ſhould ſend the enemy like a tempeſtuous winde, which parcheth up the moiſture of the earth, and makes it barren, to cut off his proſperity to the very root, and to bereave him of what he delighted in. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. God hath all lots in his hand, to make one perſon or people increaſe and be fruitful above another, as he pleaſeth; for, <hi>Ephraim</hi> (as his name imports) <hi>is fruitful among his brethren,</hi> according to <hi>Jacobs</hi> prophecie, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.19. See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75.6, 7. 2. Such as are moſt advanced by God in outward things, do ordinarily ripen moſt for ſtroaks; for, <hi>fruitful Ephraim</hi> by his carriage draweth this judgement on himſelf. 3. Mens proſperous condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Gods bounty toward them of that kinde, will not avail them, when they ripen for judgements; for, <hi>though he be fruitful among his brethren, an eaſt-winde ſhall come.</hi> 4. Judgements for ſin will look very boiſterous and dreadful-like, eſpecially to the guilty conſcience; for, it ſhall be an <hi>Eaſtwinde,</hi> which was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous in theſe parts, and <hi>a winde from the wilderneſſe,</hi> where windes rage moſt, or, whence the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> came. 5. Judgements will be the more ſad, when God is ſeen a party in them, and that this tempeſt is <hi>the winde of the Lord,</hi> not only a great winde (as this phraſe often imports the greatneſſe of a thing) but raiſed by him to purſue them. 6. Though the proſperous condition of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may ſeem to be ſuch as will never faile, as if it were a ſtream fed from a ſpringing fountain, yet wrath from God will ſoon reach the bottom of all theſe, and utterly ſtrip the ſinner; for, <hi>his ſpring ſhall become dry, and his fountain ſhall be dried up.</hi> 7. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will not ſecure againſt wrath, nor need men think that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and pleaſant things at uſed to ſin will continue with them; for, <hi>he</hi> (that is, <hi>Aſhur</hi> and the Lord by him) <hi>ſhall ſpoile the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of all pleaſant veſſels,</hi> or, <hi>ſtuffe:</hi> He ſhall take away what they treaſured up, as of moſt worth, and to be kept in greateſt ſafety.</p>

And partly, a deſcription of their repentance, together with the reaſons &amp; motives therof; ſome whereof are imported in their name, and the names and titles which God taketh to himſelf here; and ſome are expreſſed, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the prejudice they had ſuſtained by their ſinful wayes. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Kindneſſe betwixt God and his people, doth alway begin on his ſide, even after they have provoked him; For, here he followeth them with an exhortation to returne, before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114928:137"/>
2. One ſpecial mean whereby God brings about his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of converting his people, is doctrine and exhortations, by and with which he communicates efficacy and life; for, theſe exhortations do neither import that they have power of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to return, nor do they leave the matter uncertain; but they are in effect a Prophecy and promiſe, that in due time he will ſtirre them up effectually, and make theſe arguments and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives effectual upon them, as appeareth from the promiſes that are ſubjoyned: And therefore they who are not wrought upon by this mean, would conſider how deſperate that ſpeaks their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be. 3. In the practice of repentance, there would be a ſtop made in our ſinful courſes, conſidering whither they tend; and a turning home even to God, and a cloſing with him by faith, for that end; for, ſo much is imported in this exhortation, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> (which imports they ſhould go no further on in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe, but ſhould come back, and that) <hi>to the Lord,</hi> and that they may do this, they ought to lay hold on God as their own by Covenant, and in Chriſt thy God. 4. When men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what they are, and what dignity is conferred upon them by God, it may make them aſhamed to lie ſtill in ſin without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; For, <hi>O Iſrael return,</hi> they who are <hi>Iſrael</hi> and exalted to be a peculiar people, ſhould be aſhamed not to obey this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. 5. It may invite ſinners to repentance, that God to whom they are invited, is the only fountain of all good to them that come to him; For, ſaith he, <hi>returne to J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may alſo encourage to this exerciſe, that ſuch as turne to him, will finde that their ſin, and a long tract of judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, hath not made void a Covenant-intereſt in God; for, ſaith he, <hi>returne to thy God,</hi> that relation ſtands ſtill. 7. Such as do rightly believe an intereſt in God, will be kept from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming, and will be afraid to provoke him to forefault their right; For, ſo alſo doth the argument run, if be be <hi>thy God,</hi> then <hi>returne.</hi> 8.

Such as are convinced of their ſad condition by ſin, will ſeriouſly think on repentance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God, who only can recover their loſt condition; And will be encouraged ſo to do, when they conſider that there is yet any hope for ſuch forlorne ones as they are; For, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>return to the Lord thy God, for thou haſt fallen.</hi> Thoughts

                     <p>Followeth a direction from God how to proſecute repentance, and what to ſay unto him when they turne to him. They are directed, 1. To pray for removal of ſin, and for gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, or getting of good. 2. To engage themſelves to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer praiſe, and to renounce their former carnal and ſinful confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences. 3. To profeſſe their perſwaſion of Gods mercy to the needy and afflicted, as the ground of their prayer, and of their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto God.</p>
                     <p>From the general direction, <hi>[Take with you words, and turne to the LORD, ſay unto him, &amp;c.] Learn,</hi> 1. The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that a penitent and turning people make much uſe of prayer, as the mean to remedie and finde eaſe of their grievances; Therefore doth he direct them here to that exerciſe. 2. The Lord requireth that not only a penitents inward man ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed before God in prayer; but that he ſhould employ his mouth and words alſo, as a mean appointed for ſtirring up affections, and as a teſtimony of his devoting the whole man to the ſervice of God; Therefore doth he require that they bring <hi>words, and ſay to God.</hi> 3. Our words in prayer ought not be ſuch, nor ſo ordered as we pleaſe; but God is the preſcriber of our prayers, whoſe directions we are bound to follow; For, ſo much doth this direction given by him, teach. 4. It may be the condition of Gods humble and exerciſed people, that they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their own diſpoſitions, nor get their hearts brought in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:114928:138"/>
frame before God; In which caſe, however he abhorre theſe who draw near him with their lips, when they remove their heart farre from him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13. yet they wo are ſenſible of the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſſe of their heart, ought not to ſtay away becauſe of that, but ſhould come if it were but with words to God, to ſeek of him that he would give them more to bring unto him: So much may be gathered from this, <hi>Take with you words,</hi> albeit they could command no more. 5. Gods humble people may be alſo ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and confounded, that they will not know what to ſpeak or ſay before him, till he come and guide them; So much alſo may be imported, in that God muſt teach them what to ſay, <hi>Take with you words.</hi> See <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Job</hi> 6.2, 3. 6. When the Lord intends good to a people, it is his uſual way to give them the ſpirit of ſupplication, and ſet them about prayer: And he is ſo willing to be reconciled with humbled ſinners, that he will furniſh them who want furniture to call on him; For, ſaith he, <hi>Take with you words, ſay unto the Lord,</hi> which is in effect a promiſe, that in due time he will furniſh repenting <hi>Iſrael</hi> with ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to call on him. 7. Whatever weak endeavours in prayer, the Lord accept in his people; yet ſuch as would pray aright, ought to have their face toward God, and in their practice endeavour ſtill to be turning more and more to him; For, ſaith he, <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord, ſay unto him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the firſt branch of the petition, [<hi>Take away all iniquity,</hi> wherein they pray for removal of ſin] <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents care and ſolicitude is chiefly about ſin, how to be rid of it; Therefore they complain of it in the firſt place as the chief bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And indeed where guilt remaines, the removing of cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities would not be in mercy, but would ſtill tend to worſe; and where ſin is pardoned, though calamities continue, yet they change their nature, and are bleſſed. 2. The zeale of true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents is not partial, but ſtrikes againſt all ſin, greater or leſſer, more or leſſe beloved; For, they pray, <hi>take away all iniquity.</hi> 3. Men may be truly penitent for ſin, when yet they cannot get themſelves rid of it; yea, when a penitent is moſt convinced, he cannot remove either the guilt, or power, or penall effects of ſin, till God interpoſe; Therefore are they put to God with it, <hi>take away all iniquity</hi> 4. God is alſufficient to remove ſin, and will do ſo to the penitent, according to his promiſe. He will pardon the guilt of it, will ſubdue the power, and purge the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of it by degrees; till once for all he give a compleat vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:114928:139"/>
and he will remove the penall effects, or plagues that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon ſin, when he hath done his work by them, and when it is for the penitents good to want them; For, this direction to pray, <hi>take away all iniquity,</hi> doth not only import Gods power to do this, but is in effect a promiſe, that he will grant this ſuite, which himſelf puts in their mouth, as the following promiſes make clear.</p>
                     <p>From the ſecond branch of the petition, [<hi>and receive us gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly,</hi> or <hi>give good] Learn,</hi> 1. It is of Gods graciouſneſſe that the penitent ſinner is pardoned, and when ſin is pardoned, it is ſtill grace that receiveth the penitent; Therefore it is ſubjoyned according to the tranſlation, <hi>and receive us graciouſly.</hi> 2. Man is an empty creature of all good, and any good he hath is from God; So much doth the other reading teach, <hi>and give good.</hi> The word doth indeed ſignifie to <hi>take,</hi> or <hi>receive</hi> good; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood of God, it importeth to take it that he may give it, as a man taketh his gift in his hand, and then beſtoweth it. And it is moſt clear of Chriſt, who receiveth gifts or good things, that he may beſtow them upon men, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ</hi> 4.8. explaineth the ſame word of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. which is here uſed. 3. Till a people become penitent, and flee to God through Chriſt for the pardon of ſin, they cannot expect any good thing at Gods hand, or that any thing they get will be good unto them; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſubjoyned to the former ſuite, as following upon it, <hi>Take away all iniquity, and do good.</hi> 4. When a penitent hath fled to God through Chriſt for remiſſion of ſin, they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that then all Gods dealing toward them is good, and will tend to their good; For, when the firſt petition is granted, then will he hear this ſuite alſo, <hi>and do good.</hi>

                     <p>From the firſt engagement, to offer praiſe, being heard in their requeſts, <hi>[ſo will we render the calves of our lips] Learn,</hi> 1. Praiſe offered up through Chriſt, from an humble heart, is the ſubſtance of the ceremony of thank-offerings; Therefore is it called <hi>the calves of our lips,</hi> as being the ſubſtance of theſe calves and other beaſts that were offered up. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.30, 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. 2. Gods hearing and reſpecting of penitents lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon them an obligation to praiſe, and they ought to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their good condition by ſuch an exerciſe; For, ſay they, <hi>ſo will we render the calves of our lips.</hi> 3. When people in their low condition have an inclination to praiſe, and to glorifie God
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:114928:139"/>
by mercies when they ſhall receive them, it is an argument that God will hear and grant; For, ſo are they taught to plead, <hi>Take away all iniquity, &amp;c. ſo will we render, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.13, 14. 4. As men muſt employ their tongue as their glory, as well as their heart in Gods praiſe; ſo they who make conſcience of praiſe, will eſteem but meanly of their performance before God, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the poor fruit of their lips, when it is at the beſt; for theſe cauſes do they call it <hi>the calves of our lips.</hi>

                     <p>From the ſecond engagement, <hi>[Aſhur ſhall not ſave us &amp;c.]</hi> wherein they renounce carnal confidences in forreigne helps, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Aſhur;</hi> and in military preparations, under the name of <hi>horſes,</hi> (of which, See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.1. and do renounce I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, both as an argument of hearing, and an obligation being heard; <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. The zeal of penitents, though it be univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and impartial, yet it will be eſpecially bent againſt particular ſins, ſuch as they have been moſt addicted unto and guilty of; ſo much appeareth in their reſolving againſt theſe courſes, which had ſo oft miſled them. 2. Praiſe muſt be joyned with new o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and a thankful ſenſe of Gods mercies will excite men thereunto; Therefore is it ſubjoyned to the former engagement, <hi>Aſhur ſhall not ſave us, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Men are naturally endleſſe in falſe refuges, when they renounce God; For they run to <hi>Aſhur,</hi> multiply <hi>horſes,</hi> and <hi>ſay to the work of their hands, Ye are our gods.</hi> 4. All theſe are but vain confidences when theſe who lean to them have moſt need; And a penitent will ſee them to be ſo, and renounce them as ſuch; For, they engage themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all of them, neither to ſeek nor expect ſafety from <hi>Aſhur,</hi> or confederacies with heathen and profane Nations, nor to rely upon horſes or military preparations, nor to put Idols in the room of the true God, but that they will reject them, never to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>any more.</hi>

It is the Churches lot to be very deſolate and Orphan-like in the world; For, they are driven to look to the lot of <hi>the fatherleſſe.</hi> The cruelty of men puts them oft-times in this condition, and God permits it to be ſo, that they may be fitted for mercy. 2. Gods compaſſion and the ſweet manife<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtations thereof, are eſpecially reſerved for the time of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

low condition, and their greateſt need; For, as it is of general verity, that God hath a tender reſpect to Orphans; ſo when his Church is low, ſhe hath cauſe to look that in him <hi>the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe</hi> will <hi>finde mercy.</hi> 3. The confidence of Gods reſpect to his humble people, would be cheriſhed by the needy and penitent, to encourage them to come to him, and call upon him; For, it is a reaſon why they thus come to God, <hi>for in thee the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe findeth mercy:</hi> wherein they are directed to have, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their truſt in him. 4 Such as would comfortably lay hold on God in their need, ought to make mercy their claime; Which as it is let out to the unworthy, and ſuch as do deſerve ill: So the faith and apprehenſion of it may ſweeten their thought and meditation on all his other attributes unto them; Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they be in an Orphan-condition, yet that which they look to is only mercy. 5. Such as do apprehend and believe the mercy of God toward his needy people, will renounce all carnal and ſinful confidences; as knowing that God is alſufficient of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and that he will not have any communion with Idols, nor will he help them who look to any refuge beſide him: Therefore alſo is this a reaſon why they renounce their former courſes, <hi>for in thee the fatherleſſe findeth mercy.</hi>

                     <p>Followeth Gods anſwer to this prayer which he will put in the mouth of converted <hi>Iſrael;</hi> wherein he removes and anſwers all their doubts, in ſeveral promiſes. And firſt, for the matter of iniquity, (for the removal of which they had prayed,) he promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to heal their back-ſliding, in its guilt, pollution, and effects, (though the laſt of theſe be more expreſſely ſpoken to in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing promiſes:) And that he will do this for them, out of his own free love to them; from whence alſo it is, that he turnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his juſtly manifeſted anger, and is pacified toward them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Gods giving of a ſpirit of prayer, is a ſure pledge of a good anſwer; for, what he directed them to ſeek, <hi>v.</hi> 2. now he grants. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. 2. The great ſin of the Church, is Apoſtaſie and defection from her profeſſions, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and yokes which ſhe hath taken on, and ſubmitted unto; For, it is <hi>back-ſliding,</hi> or <hi>turning away.</hi> 3. Albeit they had pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:114928:140"/>
againſt <hi>all iniquity, v.</hi> 2. yet now he mentions only <hi>back-ſliding;</hi> partly, becauſe Apoſtaſie hath a complex of many ſins and provocations in it; and partly, to teach, that if the worſt of ills do not hinder Gods help, nor are above his cure, far leſſe will ſmaller ſins ſtand in his way. 4. Sin doth bring a wound and ſickneſſe upon the ſinner; It is a loathſome diſeaſe which debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateth ſtrength, cauſeth paine and anguiſh, if the ſinner were ſenſible; and being continued in, it tendeth to death; For, back-ſliding muſt be <hi>healed.</hi> 5. The wound of ſin is above the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners own cure, till God take him in hand; For, it is God who muſt <hi>heal back-ſliding.</hi> 6. Apoſtaſie requireth not only the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God to cure it, and to reclaime the ſinner from his wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and eſtabliſh him being reclaimed; But it requireth alſo no ſmall art, and a Phyſicians hand to recover it; And ſo to launce the ſore, as the back-ſlider may ſee the evil of his way, and not be ſecure or preſumptuous though God recover him; and yet ſo to ſupport the patient with cordials and encouragements, as a ſight of his caſe make him not heartleſſe, and drive him further away; For, the word imports to play the skilful Phyſician in healing back-ſliding. 7. God is an able and skilful Phyſician for ſuch diſeaſes; and to the penitent he will give a proof of his skill in curing back-ſliding; the guilt of it, by a pardon; the pollution and power of it, by ſanctification, and putting his fear in their heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. the anguiſh and pain of it, by giving them his peace; and the effects thereof, by removing judgements in his time and way; For it is his expreſſe promiſe, <hi>I will heal their back-ſliding.</hi> 8. Such as are truly convinced and penitent, will ſee no worth in themſelves, wherefore God ſhould do them any good; But the more penitent they are, the more will they ſee the need of free-love; Therefore do they need this promiſe, <hi>I will love them freely,</hi> to ſecure all other promiſes unto them. 9. As the love of God is the great encouragement of the humble ſinner, and the fountain of Gods bounty toward him; So it is his great advantage, that this love is free in it ſelf, and in its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as being the love of an alſufficient God, who needs not, nor can be hired by the creature: So that no objection of worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſeneſſe in the creature, can hinder him to look for that which is free; Therefore it is held out for their encouragement, <hi>I will love them freely, ingenuouſly,</hi> without guile, and <hi>liberally,</hi> as it beſeemeth a rich and infinit God to communicate himſelfe. 10. Where ſin is unrepented of, there is anger from the Lord which ſhould be chiefly looked to and laid to heart in afflictions;
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:114928:141"/>
for, ſo is imported, that <hi>anger</hi> had been upon them, under which all their afflictions are comprehended. 11. The Lords former diſpleaſure manifeſted in ſad effects, will not hinder the manifeſtation of his free-love to the penitent; and upon repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, anger will be turned away out of every lot by Gods free-love: Therefore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>for mine anger is turned away from him;</hi> where he giveth this both as an evidence and aſſurance of his love toward them, becauſe the controverſie is now ended; and therefore they need not doubt of his love. 12. <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom theſe promiſes are made, is ſometime ſpoken of in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall number, <hi>them;</hi> ſometime in the ſingular number, <hi>to him;</hi> not only becauſe a People or Nation, is ſometime ſpoken of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, as one, and ſometime diſtributively, as many: But further it may teach, that what God is to one, he will be alſo to all penitents; and his favour to a penitent Church, gives ample ground of encouragement to every particular penitent; yea, in his turning away of his anger from a Church, he will have a particular reſpect to the grievances that every one have endured, to ſee them richly recompenced.</p>

                     <p>In the next place, God anſwers their ſuite concerning doing of them good, and receiving of them graciouſly. And firſt, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, through the influence of his grace and bleſſing, to make them flouriſh, as flowers and trees of all kindes do by dew and rain. What this may point at of the temporal proſperity of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their being ſo rooted and fixed in it, as no oppoſition ſhall prevaile againſt them, I leave to the Lord by his performance to expound. But certainly it holds out the flouriſhing, beautifull and ſure eſtate of the Church of converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition of the converted among them, (who will be very many) in their ſpiritual eſtate. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. God can eaſily when he pleaſeth, alter the diſconſolate and deſolate eſtate of a Church, or particular perſons; For, all theſe promiſes are oppoſite to former curſes denounced againſt them, (as, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.16. and 13.15. and elſe-where) which now he promiſeth to turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to contrary bleſſings. 2. God anſwereth the prayers of his needy
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:114928:141"/>
people richly, and ſo as may commend his love and fulneſſe; for, in anſwer to their ſhort petition, <hi>do good,</hi> all theſe promiſes are made. His knowledge of our caſe, and his love to us, is infinitly beyond any skill or love that is in our ſelves. See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.20. 3. <hi>Iſrael</hi> will yet be made to revive and flouriſh, and Gods bleſſing will make that Nation not only become a Church, but proſper in that ſtate; For, this promiſe is expreſſely made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, who have now ſo long time layn under the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the formerly denounced threatenings. 4. As all the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of a Church or particular perſons, floweth from divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and bleſſing, and ſo they have nothing to boaſt of in themſelves; So a penitent and pardoned people may expect that God will make them to revive and flouriſh through his bleſſing; For, unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> unto whom the former promiſe is made, <hi>v.</hi> 4. it is likewiſe added, <hi>I will be as the dew to Iſrael,</hi> to make him fruitful and flouriſhing, as trees and flowers are through dew and rain. 5. Such is the compleat and perfect bleſſedneſſe of a people or perſon who abides under the drop of Gods influence and grace, that no one ſimilitude can expreſſe it; Therefore are ſo many conjoyned here, becauſe no one of them could ſet it out fully; for, <hi>a lilly,</hi> though it ſet out their amiable condition, by its beautiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet it is but fading, and ſo comes ſhort; and this want muſt be made up by another ſimilitude of <hi>caſting forth his roots as Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> or, taking deep root, as trees do there, that ſo they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: Again, though the trees of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which have deep roots, may point out their ſtable condition with their beauty, yet poſſibly rooted trees may not grow up; therefore another ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is requiſite, <hi>his branches ſhall ſpread.</hi> And becauſe ſuch as have abundance of branches and leaves, may not be fruitful, nor ſtill green; Therefore it is added, <hi>his beauty ſhall be as the olive-tree,</hi> which is fruitful and ſtill green, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.16. And becauſe the fruit of the Olive hath not a pleaſant ſavour; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>his ſmell ſhall be as Lebanon,</hi> where variety of trees and flowers caſt a fragrant ſmell. In a word, to be under the influence of Gods grace and favour, maketh compleatly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. 6. In particular, theſe ſimilitudes pointing out the bleſſed condition of the Church of converted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the Elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, may teach, 1. God by his grace and bleſſing can make his Church and people ſingularly beautiful and pleaſan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

only can effectuate; Therefore it is added, <hi>and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon.</hi> See <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. 3. No pretext of rootedneſſe, ſobriety or ſtability, ſhould hinder the viſible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the fruits of grace; but where God works the one, he worketh the other alſo; for, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>his branches ſhall ſpread.</hi> 4. The viſible appearances of the grace of God in peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt not conſiſt in oſtentation or empty ſhewes; but in reall and green fruits; For, <hi>his beauty ſhall be as the olive-tree.</hi> 5. The Church and people of God would alſo ſo endeavour to be fruitful, as that they ſtudy to be ſavoury, and to have their way not only accepted of God, but gaining alſo upon others; for, this cloſeth all, <hi>his ſmell ſhall be as Lebanon,</hi> which is refreſhful and alluring to them who finde it. 6.

                     <p>The firſt part of this <hi>v.</hi> as it is in the Original, ſeemeth to be the Lords ſpeech, poſing <hi>Ephraim</hi> what need he had of Idols, to help him to do them good? ſince he is able and willing to do all to them that is here mentioned in the end of the <hi>v.</hi> The tranſlatours with many others, take it as <hi>Ephraims</hi> ſpeech. But both may well go together; and ſo the <hi>v.</hi> is a confirmation and amplification of the former promiſes; ſhewing that God by doing theſe things to them, will convince them of the uſeleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Idols; and make them who began to renounce them, <hi>v.</hi> 3. grow yet more in deteſtation of them, conſidering that God is ready to hear, obſerve, protect and bleſſe, and make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When God takes his people in hand, he can ſoon let them ſee the vanity and uſeleſſeneſſe of Idols, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what he is; For, ſaith he, <hi>Ephraim, what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> or, what need is there, thou ſhouldſt have recourſe to them, when I deal ſo well with thee? 2. As repentance ought ſtill to be on the growing hand; ſo the more a people taſte of Gods goodneſſe, they will loath their former wayes the more, and will be ſenſible of their too long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in them: For, ſo do the words, as they are in the tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, teach; when God ſhall deal thus with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as is promiſed, <hi>then Ephraim ſhall ſay, What have I to do any more</hi> (having too long continued in another opinion) <hi>with Idols?</hi>
                        <pb n="268" facs="tcp:114928:143"/>
3. As God is the hearer of his peoples prayers; ſo this is a ſpecial mean to convince them of the excellency of God above Idols. They who pray much, and get proofes of Gods hearing, will eaſily ſee the emptineſſe of all things and courſes, in compariſon of God; for, this is one proof, <hi>I have heard him,</hi> and therefore may the Lord poſe <hi>Ephraim;</hi> and he ſhould ſay, <hi>what have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> 4. The Lord doth not only encourage his people to cloſe with him only, by hearing of their prayer; but by his <hi>obſerving</hi> of them, that is, by turning his face, being now reconciled toward them, by his tender eye and care upon them and their condition, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 121.4, 5. And (which followeth upon the former) by his doing for them, above what they aske, even all that he ſeeth them to need; <hi>I have obſerved him,</hi> ſaith he, and that is another argument. 5. As Saints in returning from ſinful courſes, may meet with many ſcorching blaſts; So in God there is ſufficient protection againſt them, to keep his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from miſſing Idols; for, it is another confirmation, <hi>I am like a green fir-tree,</hi> which being fruitleſſe, ſpends it ſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual greenneſſe, and ſo is a refreſhful ſhadow. 6. The Lord is alſo unto his people, a fountain and ſpring of bleſſings, which other refuges cannot give, and he will make them fruitful in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good word and work; for it is another encouragement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation in their reſolution of renouncing Idols, <hi>from me is thy fruit found,</hi> which is to be underſtood not only of bleſſings pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out upon them, which come only from God, without whom they would be barren: but of their fruitfulneſſe in duty, which as it is their duty, ſo it is his promiſe: And as he aſcribes it to them in his free rewarding of it; ſo they are bound to make uſe of him through faith, for enabling to it, and to aſcribe it all to him, by ſelf-denial, (both when they go about it, and when it is done) and by praiſe.</p>

                     <p>The Prophet ſubjoynes a concluſion to the whole Prophecy: where, by <hi>the wayes of the Lord,</hi> we are to underſtand not only the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:114928:143"/>
directions preſcribed by him for us to walk by, but that generally it relates to his whole preceding doctrine, both concerning mans duty, and Gods diſpenſations in threatenings and promiſes, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and mercies; Theſe he invites all who would prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be wiſe indeed, ſeriouſly to conſider, and draw them to uſe and practice; as being right and ſtreight in themſelves, and ſuch as godly men will walk in, though the wicked fall and come to ruine by them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord takes pains to inculcate divine doctrine by his ſervants, it is our part not to let it be loſt, through want of application and uſe-making; for, this is the ſcope of this concluſion. 2. The uſe that ſhould be made of divine Doctrine, is not only ſimply to take up duty and diſpenſations; but prudently and practically to ponder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of what moment they are to our eternal well and wo, what is called for at our hand, and how neceſſary and important it is that we give obedience; for, ſo much is implied in this <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>knowing theſe things.</hi> 3. However men do pretend to much policy and prudence in their ſleighting of God, and his minde and will, both in duty and diſpenſations; yet it is only true wiſdome that leads men to the Word to take up duty, and Gods minde in his dealing, and ſeriouſly to ponder on them as becometh; And for the right performance hereof, there is a gift of wiſdome requiſite, even the opening of the eyes of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to ſee the marvells of the Law, and for taking up what his Word ſaith in every condition, and under every diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; For, <hi>the wiſe and prudent ſhall underſtand and know theſe things,</hi> as he hath publiſhed them from the Lord by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the former Doctrine. 4. This divine and true wiſdome will be found very rare, even in the Church, the moſt part living by their ſenſe, paſſion, will, or carnal reaſon, not regarding du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they are enjoyned in the Word, nor laying weight on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes or threatenings, nor looking on diſpenſations as they are expounded in the Word; For, <hi>who is wiſe</hi> and <hi>prudent?</hi> ſaith he, which is not only an excitation to all to ſeek after it, but a regrate, that ſo few did minde it, or attain to it. 5. However carnal men do condemne, and load the wayes of God (in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing duty, or in his diſpenſations) with prejudices; yet they are all right and ſtreight, and not to be quarrelled; as being his who may preſcribe what he will, and give the Law to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and not they to themſelves; and may do what he pleaſeth, and not according as men would limit him: and his wayes being ſuch as tend to the good of ſuch as obey the command, and walk
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:114928:144"/>
as beſeemeth under diſpenſations; for, <hi>the wayes of the Lord</hi> (wherein he enjoyneth us to walk, and wherein he walks toward us) <hi>are right.</hi> 6. However many will not ſubmit to this verdict of Gods wayes; yet he will not want witneſſes to juſtifie him and his wayes, by walking in the way of duty, whatever they meet with, and bearing out, and living under all diſpenſations, and that not for a fit only, but conſtantly and uniformely; For, <hi>the juſt ſhall walk in them.</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 17.8, 9. Such as would thus glorifie God, muſt firſt be juſt and righteous by fleeing to Chriſt for renovation of their nature, that they may have a principle of new obedience; and for daily influence, to carry them on in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and for peace and reconciliation with God through him, that this may be an encouragement to obedience, and may guard their hearts againſt ſad diſpenſations: They muſt alſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be ſingle and ſincere, that unſoundneſſe and by-reſpects do not turne them out of the way; For, they are <hi>the firſt,</hi> in both theſe reſpects, who <hi>ſhall walk in them.</hi> 8. Such as inſtead of walking, do ſtumble at duty, accounting of every moat in the way as if it were a mountain, and are offended with diſpenſations when they are not ſuch as they would; they do prove themſelves to be wicked tranſgreſſours, and any ſtumbling they have, is a plague upon them, and a preſage of moe neck-breaks they have to meet with, both by their own further ſinful ſtumbling, and by Gods breaking of them in pieces in due time: For, <hi>but the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours ſhall fall therein,</hi> by their own ſinful ſtumbling at Gods Word and dealing, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. and by Gods cauſing them to fall in end, and come to miſerable ruine.</p>

What Gods ſervants deliver in his Name is not their own, but ſhould be looked on as Gods Word; for, it was <hi>the Word of the Lord that came to Joel.</hi> He did not ſeigne this, nor is it leſſe the Word of God, that God ſent it by a weak man. 2. The minde of God is not to be ſought nor enquired after in the fanatick revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of wilde ſpirits; but in what he hath mediately delivered to the Church by his extraordinary officers, and hath regiſtrate in his Word; for, <hi>the Word of the Lord came to Joel the ſonne of Pethuel,</hi> and by his Miniſtery to the Church in all ages. 3. It is Gods great mercy toward his Church, that when ſtroaks are on, or coming on them, he leaveth them not without his Word, which may expound his dealing toward them, and direct them how to carry under it; for, in or about the time of this ſad ſtroak, <hi>the Word of the Lord came to Joel;</hi> See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94.12. 4.

This he doth not propound nakedly, but as ſingular, and to be obſerved as ſuch; it was ſo ſingular, that none of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt in <hi>Judah,</hi> either by themſelves, or by report from their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, had ever known the like; and their poſterity even to the fourth generation ſhould never ſee the like, but as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it ſhould come to after ages, they ſhould think upon it as a prodigious judgement.

                        </gap>. Albeit theſe inſects be only named here as the cauſe of their famine; yet it ſeemeth alſo, that either before, or with, or after them, there was rotting unſeaſonable raines in ſeed-time, <hi>v.</hi> 17. and a drought likewiſe cauſing it, which is expreſſed under the name of <hi>withering, v.</hi> 12. and of <hi>fire, v.</hi> 19, 20. which that it cannot be underſtood only of theſe creatures devouring all, as fire doth, is clear from <hi>v.</hi> 20. where it is, <hi>the rivers of water are dried up.</hi> 2. It is not neceſſary for us peremptorily to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine whether the Prophet ſpeak of this as a judgement already lying on, or ſhortly to be inflicted; ſeeing it is uſual with the Prophets to ſet out approaching judgements, as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and it is certain that ſome of theſe (at leaſt) were only near and <hi>at hand, v.</hi> 15. 3. As for the continuance of theſe plagues, it is certain they laſted for ſome ſucceſſive yeares, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.25. but it is neither ſafe nor needful to determine, whether the firſt came and ſpoiled one year, and the ſecond the next year, ſpoillng what had been reſerved the former yeare, and ſo on for four yeares; or whether in every one of the yeares they came all, every one after another. It is likewiſe needleſſe to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether the drought was a new plague, after theſe were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, or was ſent with them or before them. 4. The ſetting out of this ſtroak as ſingular, doth nothing contradict what is ſaid of the plague of locuſts on <hi>Egypt</hi> as ſingular, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.14. for that on <hi>Egypt</hi> was ſingular for the great number of one kinde of inſects, and their doing ſo much in ſo ſhort a time; but this is ſingular for the great numbers of divers kindes, ſucceeding one another, and their continuing ſo long to be a ſcourge. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When men become incorrigible, and ſin ripens to an height, then the Lord will reprove and plead againſt it by judgements, and not by his Word only; for, whereas the method of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets is, firſt to reprove ſin, then to threaten for it, and then to
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:114928:146"/>
ſubjoyne exhortations to repentance with encouragements and promiſes; This Prophet doth at firſt point out their ſin and guilt as to be read in viſible judgements. 2. Famine is one of the rods whereby the Lord pleads againſt his Church for her ſin, and ſtrippes her of abuſed mercies, and of tentations to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe and rebellion; for, ſuch is his rod here. 3. God can, when he pleaſeth, arme very mean and contemptible creatures to execute his judgements, and particularly to deprive man of the fruits of the ground; for, here he ſends out <hi>the palmer-worme, the locuſt, the cauker-worm, and caterpillar,</hi> and they <hi>eat</hi> up all, It were a needleſſe labour to deſcribe every one of theſe little creatures, and ſhew the difference of each of them from another, it being ſufficient in general to know that they were ſuch as Gods Omnipotency ſhined in doing ſo great things by them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the threatenings of his Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.38, 39, 42. 4. As God hath ſtill one ſcourge after another, wherewith to plague a ſinful and incorrigible people, who will not repent, but think to eſcape with the plagues that have come on them, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26, 18, 21, &amp;c. So it ſpeaks ſad things when one calamity ſtints not the controverſie, but he purſueth ſtill with one judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after another, and with breach upon breach; for, ſo is it here, what one left another did eat up. See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.12, 17, 21. 5. Albeit the Lord in every age be teſtifying his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt ſin, yet at ſome times, and when ſin is come to a great height, he may make one age a remarkable ſpectacle of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and bring judgements on them, the like whereof have not been in many generations; for, ſuch was his dealing with this generation, their fathers, paſt memory of man, rhad not ſeen the like, nor ſhould the like be ſeen for many generations to come. 6. Such diſpenſations ought to be eſpecially obſerved and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for uſe, and that not only by the preſent, but by ſucceeding generations, who alſo are not to let them die and weare out of memory; for, <hi>Heare this ye old men, and give eare all ye inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the land; Tell ye your children of it.</hi> It is mens du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be wiſe obſervers of Gods judgements, eſpecially when they are ſingular; and ſuch as forget what hath been done on others, may be taught the ſame leſſon on their own expences; See, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 28.5. and 64.9. 7. Albeit the Lords ſingular judgements be very loud and ſpeaking, yet ſuch is mans natural dulneſſe and ſtupidity, his unprofitable aſtoniſhment (uſually) under the rod, and his forgetfulneſſe if once delivered from it, that he needs to be ſtirred up by the Word, to conſider or inculcate them on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;

and dreadful, and make great havock; for, this is <hi>a Nation whoſe teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion,</hi> and therefore <hi>layeth the vine waſte, &amp;c.</hi> without reſiſtance. Gods being a Party will make a ſmall ſcourge heavy, and his judgements executed even by ſuch will prove irreſiſtible. 2. As the ſmiting of the fruits of the ground is for mens ſin; ſo ſuch is the ſtupidity of men, that preſent ſtroaks will not do at them, ſo long as there is any hope of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and till all probable ground of hope be cut off; therefore muſt not only the fruit be eaten, but the trees be made white with peeling, and meet to be caſt away to affect them; <hi>he hath laid my vine waſte, and barked my fig-tree, &amp;c.</hi> 3. In intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this judgement, the Lord (or the Prophet in his Name,) cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the land, <hi>my land,</hi> and the trees, <hi>my vine, my fig-tree,</hi> to teach, 1. That intereſt in God, eſpecially if it be but in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal way, and by reaſon of viſible intereſt in priviledges, will not hold off deſerved ſtroaks; for, albeit all theſe were the Lords, becauſe the people were his, and he had given them the land, and all that was in it, and had a ſpecial reſpect to them, and to what was theirs; yet <hi>a Nation is come up upon my land, he hath laid my vine waſte, &amp;c.</hi> 2.

The greatneſſe alſo and ſeverity of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſin, may be read in his purſuing it, even to the ſmiting of what is his; for, ſo much alſo is held out here. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. As there are many men ſo groſſe, even in the viſible Church, as to live for no other end but to abuſe themſelves and the creatures by intemperance; ſo when the Lord ſends famine upon a land, he intends to plague ſuch in a ſpecial manner thereby; therefore <hi>are drunkards and drinkers of wine;</hi> firſt alarmed with this rod, for, not only is their ſin viſible in ſuch a rod, and ſo their guilt may make it bitter, but it will eſpecially afflict them who cannot endure want ſo well as others who have lived more ſoberly. 5. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that drunkards do beſot themſelves, and do make themſelves a merry jovial life, yet God by famine can both rouze them up, and marre their mirth, <hi>Awake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>weep and howl:</hi> and if they will not repent nor be ſenſible of their provocations, or of the want of Gods favour; he will cauſe their abuſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, end in lamentation for want of occaſion to feed their luſts, and will make them howle in trouble, like beaſts, whom they reſembled in their converſation; <hi>Awake,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>weep and

                     <p>The ſecond effect of this ſtroak is, that it ſhall be matter of bitter lamentation, to ſee the interruption of the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, through the want of offerings, and of the Prieſts maintenance, by reaſon of the ſcarcity, &amp; to ſee the Lords Prieſts mourning, for both theſe cauſes. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The Lord is ſo ſevere an avenger of ſin, that he will not ſpare it, though the ſtroak ſhould reach even his own worſhip and ordinances; for, by this ſtroak for ſin, <hi>the meat-offering and the drink-offering is cut off from the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> Under theſe two all other ſacrifices and oblations are to be underſtood, which could not but be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the beaſts were conſumed as well as the fruits of the ground, <hi>v.</hi> 18, 20. and theſe are named becauſe they were ſacrifices of praiſe and thankſgiving, and therefore the joyful dayes they had in offering them, are chiefly miſſed, as <hi>v.</hi> 16. 2. Calamities and judgements are then ſad, when they reach the Lords publick worſhip and ordinances, and (however it fare with men in their own caſe) do bring an interruption to them one way or other; for, it is to be <hi>lamented,</hi> when <hi>the meat-offering and drink-offering is cut off,</hi> and ſo there is no publick worſhip nor allowance for Prieſts to wait upon it. See, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.18. 3. Men ought to be ſo far from ſelfiſhneſſe, and minding their own things only in times of calamities, that they ſhould be moſt affected with the ſufferings that are on Gods intereſts; for, this conſideration calls them to <hi>lament like a virgin girded with ſackcloth for the husband of her youth,</hi> who being newly married, or betrothed only, (and therefore called a <hi>virgin</hi>) is deprived of him by death, and that in the time of <hi>her youth,</hi> when affections are more violent and ready to reſent croſſes. 4.

ſervice: and as it is their duty to be affected and mourn for the interruption of his ſervice; ſo it is a ſad token of anger, and matter of lamentation, when they are made to mourn for neglected ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and want of livelihood and maintenance; <hi>The Prieſts, the Lords Miniſters mourn,</hi> holds forth both their office and duty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is a reaſon of that lamentation, <hi>v.</hi> 8.

                     <p>A third effect of this ſtroak, (and another cauſe of the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>v.</hi> 8.) is, that the land ſhall look with a deſolate and mournful countenance, being deſpoiled of corne, wine and oile, and that partly (as would appear from the words) by drought. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. The earth when it is bleſſed of God with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and variety of fruits, is a very pleaſant and refreſhful ſight; whereby, as it were, it rejoyceth in Gods bounty, and inviteth us to rejoyce in him, who maketh his creatures to ſmile on us, therefore it is ſaid <hi>to mourn,</hi> when theſe things are taken away; See, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.12, 13. 2. When ſinners will not mourn for ſin, it is righteous with God to reprove and puniſh that fault, by making the earth to mourn and look ſorrowful like under judgement; for, becauſe of their ſin it is, that <hi>the field is waſted, the land mourneth,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <pb n="280" facs="tcp:114928:149"/>The fourth effect is, that the Husband-men and Vine-dreſſers ſhould be aſhamed, and diſappointed of their expectations, through the barrenneſſe of land and trees; yea, and the decaying and withering of all ſorts of trees; And ſo they ſhould be made to lament, and their joy (which was uſual in harveſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.3. and 16:10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.33.) ſhould ceaſe with the ceaſing of the fruit of their labours. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit men are bound to labour for their daily bread; yet except God bleſſe, their labour will be in vaine, and their expectations by it, end in ſad diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and God is provoked ſo to deal with ſinners; For, <hi>Be ye aſhamed, O ye husband-men: howle, O ye vine-dreſſers, for the wheat, and for the barley, &amp;c.</hi> ſheweth that the iſſue of their labours, ſhould be but ſhameful diſappointment and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: See <hi>Pſ.</hi> 127.2.

Albeit men ordinarily count little of the mercy of their daily bread, and of the increaſe of their labours; yet the want of it would ſoon be felt as a ſad ſtroak, and will overturn much of their joy and chearfulneſſe; For, ſo much doth the other reaſon of their howling, (which is an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the former) import, <hi>Be aſhamed, and howle, becauſe joy is withered away from the ſons of men;</hi> that is, by the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and decay of the occaſion of it, it alſo ceaſeth. 4. The matter of mens joy is Gods gift, to give or take it away as he pleaſeth; and whatever joy, warrantable or unlawful, men have about any thing beneath God, it is but uncertain and fading, and ought to be looked on as ſuch: For, here when God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, he makes joy <hi>to wither away.</hi>

                     <p>The people being thus ſtirred up to conſider their condition under this ſtroak; The Lord proceeds to preſcribe by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the true remedy, and right uſe to be made of all this: which is, that all ſhould take with guilt, and humble themſelves before God, to deprecate his anger. And firſt, the Prieſts are exhorted to faſt and mourne in private, to fit them for obſerving a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick humiliation. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. As men can do nothing rightly under calamities, till firſt they be ſenſible of them, and of the hand of God in them: So where there is a right ſenſe of trouble, it will be poured out to God in private and publick hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations; So much doth the dependance of this purpoſe on the former, teach: When firſt they are made ſenſible of the ſtroak, now they are ſtirred up to pray and mourn. We come but ill ſpeed in prayer under trouble, either becauſe there is no ſenſe of the trouble to put us to prayer; or becauſe we let any ſenſe we have overwhelme us, and do not go to God with it. 2. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought to be made by all, of private mourning and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation under calamities: So eſpecially by the Lords publick Meſſengers and Miniſters, whether we conſider their ſpecial dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in being employed about holy things, or their obligation to be more ſenſible then others, (eſpecially where the ſtroak reacheth to Gods intereſts;) or their own peculiar guilt in drawing on the ſtroak; or, their obligation to be examples to others; or, the neceſſity they have to be ſtirred up themſelves, that ſo they may ſtirre up others; for theſe cauſes are <hi>the Prieſts, the miniſters of the Altar,</hi> (who attend upon the publick worſhip there) and the <hi>miniſters of God</hi> (devoted to him and to his ſervice) called to this duty. 3. Such as have faith of an intereſt in God, and (follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that) affection to him, will not only be active in duty themſelves, but in ſtirring up others alſo in their ſtations; For, <hi>Joel</hi> preſſeth this upon them, as being <hi>miniſters of my God,</hi> where not only their relation calls for this duty, but his intereſt and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſets him on edge to ſtirre them up. 4. It is neceſſary for
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:114928:150"/>
right humiliation, that peoples hearts be affected with the ſenſe of their caſe, and with contrition under it, and that they have much affection to God, that ſo they may be affected with the ſtroak as it lights upon what relates to him; For, it is required, they <hi>lament and howle;</hi> as an evidence of deep ſenſe and great contrition, and that they take up God as their own, <hi>your God.</hi> 5. It is alſo requiſite that they teſtifie their abject condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, and renounce carnal delights, who would deale with him effectually under calamities: For, ſo much did their ſackcloth ſignifie, <hi>Gird your ſelves,</hi> (to wit, with ſackcloath, or, as the ſpeech will alſo ſignifie, ſet quickly and nimbly about this work.

All other exerciſes of humiliation will not proſper in our hands, nor be acceptable unto God, unleſſe they be ſeaſoned and managed with faith and affection to God: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they commanded in performing this duty, to come <hi>into the houſe of the Lord your God,</hi> and there to <hi>cry.</hi>

                     <p>All the people being thus excited, and called to mourn and cry to God; the Lord by his Prophet doth furniſh them, (not with a directory or pattern of prayer, but) with ſeveral arguments and motives to humiliation, which might excite them yet more to the duty; And ſo he deſcribes yet further the greatneſſe of the calamity, and their cauſe of mourning. Which he ſpeaks of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to come, and partly as lying on, (as was before marked on <hi>v</hi> 2, 3, 4. becauſe it may be, it was inflicted in part, and more was yet coming on: or though it were all to come, yet it is not unuſual in the Prophets, that they ſet out approaching judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as if they were preſent, that ſo they may affect the more.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="284" facs="tcp:114928:151"/>The firſt argument exciting them to humiliation and calling on God, is, that this doleful day of inflicting vengeance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Omnipotency would make a great deſolation, was near at hand. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit men ordinarily look lightly on trouble at a diſtance; yet it will make them tremble and cry <hi>alas,</hi> when it cometh on them: and the thought of this ſhould move them to repent in time; for, <hi>alas for the day</hi> importeth not only the Prophets ſenſe of it at a diſtance, but by this he would ſhew them that it will be their language when it cometh; &amp; ſo uſeth it as an argument to perſwade them to repent. 2. The day of particular vengeance on impenitent ſinners, is the day of the Lord, not only becauſe he is the Author of that venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and doth determine the time of inflicting it, whether ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will or not; but becauſe thereby he will manifeſt himſelf to be the Lord, even to them who would not acknowledge him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; Therefore is this ſtroak to be inflicted, called <hi>the day of the Lord,</hi> The propinquity (and much more the preſence) of judgements ſhould be a preſſing argument of repentance; And it is the wiſdome of ſinners not to put an evil day far away, that ſo they may be ſtirred up to repent; Therefore doth he preſſe them with this, <hi>for the day of the Lord is at hand.</hi> 4. The Lord who is omnipotent, not only can bring on utter deſolation when he pleaſeth, and no creature-help can ward off his blow; But his ſinning people may expect that his ſtroak will be irreſiſtibly deſolating and waſting: And thoughts of this ſhould invite them to repent in time; for it is an argument of repentance, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Gods Omnipotency, and his ſeverity againſt them, <hi>as a deſtruction from the Almighty ſhall it come.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond argument exciting to repentance, is, that unleſſe God ſpare, not only ſhall their meat be taken away by the famine; but the ſacrifices and publick worſhip alſo: And particularly, theſe ſolemnities of worſhip, wherein they uſed to rejoyce, as in their feaſts and peace-offerings. By <hi>meat</hi> here we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, both their daily food, and their ſacrifices, which get this name, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.7. And particularly their meat-offerings,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:114928:151"/>
(which were a kinde of thank-offerings,) wherein fine floure was offered, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which are called <hi>food</hi> or <hi>meat, Lev.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.7. And ſo the latter part of the <hi>v.</hi> is but an amplification of the former, that the meat being cut off from the Houſe of God, joy and gladneſſe was alſo cut off from it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When no other thing will invite ſinners to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, God can do it by with-holding very food from men, and by threatening to cut them off by want, who will not ſerve him; For, it is an argument to repentance that <hi>the meat is cut off.</hi> See <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.47, 48. 2. The interruption of the publick worſhip of God is large as ſad as the want of neceſſary food; conſidering that our intereſt in God as <hi>our God,</hi> is confirmed and avowed thereby; and that much <hi>joy and gladneſſe,</hi> which hath been found in and by theſe Ordinances, doth then ceaſe; Therefore is it joyned with the former argument, that <hi>the meat is cut off</hi> from the Houſe of God, and ſo <hi>joy and gladneſſe is cut off from the houſe of our God.</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4. 3. Whatever may be ſaid for mens not laying to heart judgements when they are far from them; yet it is undeniable madneſſe to lie ſtupid, when they are either imminent or incumbent; for, ſaith he, <hi>is not the meat cut off before our eyes, &amp;c?</hi> and yet we will not cry to God. This it may be, was already true in part, or it was preſently to come to paſſe in a ſad manner.</p>

                     <p>The third argument is, that not only ſhould theſe inſects de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour what was ſprung up, but it ſhould be to no purpoſe to ſowe, for the ſeed ſhould rot: And therefore there ſhould be no need of Garners and Barnes, ſeeing there ſhould no corne grow; or if any eſcaped that ſtroak, and came up, yet it ſhould wither.

<pb n="286" facs="tcp:114928:152"/>
ſtroak and grew up, was withered by the drought which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; From whence alſo, (which is the fourth argument) it ſhould come to paſſe that beaſts and herds ſhould be in diſtreſſe, and groan out their life through want of paſture; yea, even the very flocks of ſheep, who uſe to ſeed on moſt dry and deſert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhould ſuffer by this. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God hath many wayes and meanes whereby to plague man, and reach his contentments; and all of theſe concurring, are little enough to ſtir him up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; For, here beſide the devouring creatures, he is alſo purſued with rotting unſeaſonable raines, and ſcorching drought. 2. God can plague mens mercies, either in the very bud, or when they are come a further length that he may diſappoint their hopes; And the concurrence of theſe diſpenſations, ought to invite to repentance: For, both are here as arguments perſwading to it, <hi>the ſeed is rotten under the clod,</hi> and <hi>the corne is withered</hi> 3. Such as make it their ſtudy, and place their happineſſe in having not only preſent means of ſubſiſtence, but in laying up great ſtore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide them, (as, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.18, 19.) may meet with a ſad diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, becauſe of their ſin: For, <hi>the garners are laid deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: the barnes are broken down,</hi> as ſerving for no uſe in this time of ſcarſity. 4. God can eaſily reach any or all of his creatures, and is provoked to plague them, becauſe of mens ſins: For, it is an evidence of his Sovereigne power and providence, and of his controverſie againſt that people, that <hi>the beaſts groan, &amp;c.</hi> 5. The deſtruction that comes upon the creatures, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities under want, ſhould invite ſinners (for whoſe cauſe they are plagued) to repentance: For, their <hi>groaning, perplexity,</hi> and <hi>deſolation</hi> is an argument, preſſing on <hi>Judah</hi> to cry to God.</p>

                     <p>The fifth argument is, that the Prophet foreſeeing, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtroak to heart, could not but cry to God, conſidering how theſe inſects, or the drought, had like a fire conſumed all
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:114928:152"/>
the paſtures, even in the deſerts; how the trees were burnt up; and how the beaſts were made to cry through want of drink and paſture. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. They who invite others to mourne, would eſſay it themſelves, and Miniſters would be affected with the judgements which they denounce in Gods Name, that ſo their example may be a mean to affect others; Therefore the Prophet draweth an argument to repentance from his own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>O Lord, to thee will I cry.</hi> 2. The Lords anger is a dreadfull party, and can eaſily conſume all creatures, to ruine the ſinner that will not repent; for, here it makes <hi>paſtures and trees</hi> be burnt up as with a fire, and <hi>drieth up rivers of waters.</hi> 3.

This ſmiting of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by God, and their crying to him in ſtraits, may alſo teach us, what the alſufficiency of God is, from whom the ordinary and daily proviſion of all creatures cometh, and who can take it away, or reſtore it at his pleaſure.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter the Lord proſecutes what he had propounded in the former Chap. ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before them the ſadneſſe of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to ſtirre them up to repent; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all he promiſeth to reſpect them upon heir repentance. And ſo, in the firſt part of the Chapter having exhorted them to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne humiliation and faſting, becauſe of that dreadful day of vengeance, that was approaching, <hi>v.</hi> 1. he doth for their upſtirring, ſet forth at large the greatneſſe and dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that judgement; ſhewing that the number of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects ſhould be ſo great as to over-cloud the skie, and over-ſpread the land, to the great perplexity of men, <hi>v.</hi> 2. that they ſhould lay the land deſolate, <hi>v.</hi> 3. that they ſhould have courage and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity like horſes, and be terrible like armed chariots, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of trained ſouldiers, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. and ſo ſhould bring an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal terrour on the people, <hi>v.</hi> 6. that they ſhould not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the fruits of the ground, but ſhould vexe cities and houſes, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. that they ſhould bring ſuch a calamity, as if the courſe of nature were overturned, <hi>v.</hi> 10 and that they ſhould be thus dreadful and ſucceſſeful, becauſe they are employed by God to execute his threatenings, <hi>v.</hi> 11. In the ſecond part of the Chap. the Lord exhorts them to ſincere repentance, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.—conſidering the graciouſneſſe of God, <hi>v.</hi>— 13. and what hope there is of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and moderation, <hi>v.</hi> 14. And he reſumes and preſſes the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exhortation to the Prieſts, to ſtir up all ſorts of people to publick and ſolemne humiliation, <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. wherein the Prieſts themſelves are to be eminently active, <hi>v.</hi> 17. In the third part of the Chap. they are encouraged to repentance by many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of great things to be done for them being penitent, and theſe both temporal relating to their preſent affliction, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. The temporall promiſes are, that Gods compaſſion and pity ſhall be manifeſted toward them and their land, <hi>v.</hi> 18. that he will provide liberally for them, to the taking away of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:114928:153"/>
                     <hi>v.</hi> 19. and that he will take away theſe inſects that had conſumed their land, <hi>v.</hi> 20. By all which the land will have allowance to rejoyce, and the beaſts not to fear, <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22. and the Church ſhall be made to rejoyce in God, who will give them plenty, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 24. and make up their loſſes by the former famine, <hi>v.</hi> 25. ſo that they ſhall have the uſe of this mercy to their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſhall praiſe God for it, <hi>v.</hi> 26.—and he ſhall by this his dealing convince them of his relation to them, and confirme the godly that they ſhall never be aſhamed, <hi>v.</hi>—26, 27. And this is the firſt ſpiritual promiſe; unto which is added further, that in the dayes of the Goſpel, he will poure out of his Spirit largely, <hi>v.</hi> 28, 29. and that, albeit many calamities and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions ſhall follow on the back of that, <hi>v.</hi> 30, 31. yet ſuch as cleave to God ſhall be ſaved, and there ſhall ſtill be a remnant to get the performance of the promiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 32.</p>

                     <p>In this Verſe the Lord by the Prophet repeats the exhortation to the Prieſts that they by ſounding of the trumpet, ſhould call the people to ſolemne humiliation; and he exhorts the people to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:114928:154"/>
tremble at this alarme of his appearing in judgement. Unto which is ſubjoyned a general intimation, that the dreadful day wherein God would infflict theſe plagues, was at hand; And this is brought in as an argument to make the exhortation effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and is proſecuted and enlarged in the following Verſes. See <hi>ch.</hi> 1.15. This <hi>blowing of the trumpet in Zion,</hi> or the <hi>holy mountaine</hi> of the Temple, is according to the direction of the Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 10.3, 9. wherein the Prieſts were to convocate the people, and to ſound an alarme in war, by blowing of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets. And both of theſe are pointed at here; They are to alarme the people, and give them warning of the approaching judgement, and to call a convocation for faſting, as it is, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever the Lord ſay to ſinners by his rod, when it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and incumbent; yet ſuch as would have good uſe of it, have need of the help of the Word and Ordinances with it, either for preven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ion, preparation, or uſe of it; For, <hi>the trumpet muſt be blown,</hi> either to warne them before it come, or to ſtirre them up to be ſenſible, and to do duty when it cometh. 2. Whoever be aſleep in times of threatened or incumbent dangers; yet Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ought eſpecially to be awake, that they may ſtir up others; For, on them is this charge laid, <hi>Blow ye the trumpet.</hi> 3. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt be faithful in diſcharging their truſt, as becometh watchmen, and they muſt not ſet themſelves to pleaſe men, but ſhould faithfully point out their danger procured by ſin; For, they muſt <hi>blow and ſound an alarme.</hi> 4. It is not enough for Miniſters to point out dangers by ſin, unleſſe they point out reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies alſo; nor is it ſufficient for people to be ſenſible of the one, unleſſe they be ſtirred up to the other; For, they are to <hi>blow the trumpet,</hi> and call to faſting, (as it is expounded, <hi>v.</hi> 15.) as well as to <hi>ſound an alarme;</hi> yea, this is but ſubſervient to the other. 5. The conſideration that a people are Gods Church, and do enjoy his preſence, is a ſpecial argument to move them to be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and ſtudy duty, in times of calamitie; For, all this is to be <hi>in Zion, and my holy mountaine,</hi> not only becauſe it was the place where the Prieſts ſounded; and where the people were to meet for ſolemne worſhip, but that all this calamitie being on a Church, (whereof <hi>Zion</hi> and the mountaine of the Temple was a type,) therefore they ſhould be ſenſible, and hearken to theſe alarmes and invitations. 6 When God threatens or inflicts judgements, it becometh all to be deeply ſenſible, and not to pleaſe themſelves with formality, or trifle with outward ſhewes, but they ſhould quake at the heart, at the tokens of Gods anger; and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:114928:154"/>
it is great courage not to harden our ſelves, but to tremble before an angry God; for, <hi>the inhabitants of the land</hi> are to <hi>tremble,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the alarme and call to humiliation and repentance.

                     <p>That the thoughts of this ſad day may take deep impreſſion, and ſtir them up; a deſcription of it is held forth at large, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral branches, as ſo many arguments preſſing them to repent and tremble before God. The firſt branch of the deſcription, is, that this troop of devouring creatures, (called <hi>a people</hi> or Nation, as, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.6.) being armed with Gods power, ſhould come in ſo great a number as to cover and hide the ſight of the skie and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: (as alſo to put the people in great trouble and perplexity, which is figuratively pointed at by a dark day, <hi>Iſa</hi> 5.30. and 8.22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.7, 8. <hi>Amos</hi> 5.18.)

As it is the Lords way to make a time of calamity for ſin, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable and full of darkneſſe and perplexity; So this ſhould ſerve to affect ſinners, and to humble and ſtirre them up to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; For, ſo much doth this <hi>day of darkneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively taken, import: and it is propounded here as an argument to make that exhortation, <hi>v.</hi> 1. effectual. 2.

Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily mens ſtupidity is ſo great when judgements are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, that multitudes of upſtirrings, and repreſentations of their woful condition, is little enough to affect them: So much doth this inſiſting and multiplying of ſimilitudes, teach. 2.

                     <p>The fourth branch of the deſcription, and an effect of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is, that the noiſe of the approach of theſe creatures in troops, and the ſight of them, ſhall breed a general and univerſal terrour among men, accompanied with blackneſſe of face, not ſo much through the famine which ſhall follow after, (as, <hi>Lam.</hi> 4.8.) as through deadly fear and terrour ſtriking them to the heart.

Albeit the Church that ſhould be for God, would not only ly by, but provoke him to be an enemie; yea, albeit there ſhould be no men to appear in his quarrel; Yet he can eaſily when he pleaſeth, raiſe a numerous and ſtrong army, beſeeming ſuch a General; Therefore it is added, <hi>for his camp is very great,</hi> ſo as he may owne them for his Army, and ſend them out on ſervice. 4. The ſtrength of any inſtruments of vengeance, and their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, is to be aſcribed to God, who is ſo nuchangeable in his holy juſtice, as he will execute his threatenings againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent; And who is Omnipotent ſo to do by any inſtruments he pleaſeth; for, it is a reaſon of the ſtrength of his Army, <hi>for he is ſtrong that executeth his word.</hi> 5. Divine wrath will be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:114928:158"/>
found intolerable, when it comes to be executed; and whatever ſinners dream, yet there is no reſiſting nor abiding of a day of vengeance, nor any refuge againſt it, but by turning to God by faith and unfeigned repentance; For, ſo much is held out in this further confirmation of the reaſon of the ſtrength of this Army, <hi>for the day of the Lord</hi> (and not of the appearing of theſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures only,) <hi>is great and very terrible, and who can abide it?</hi>

                     <p>Followeth the ſecond part of the Chap. wherein the Lord calls upon them to make right uſe of this calamity, and of the warning given them. This he doth in two exhortations; whereof the firſt (in theſe verſes,) is, That they ſhould ſet about ſincere repentance and humiliation, teſtified by holy private faſts and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrow, and ſo prove that they are really converted to God, and reconciled to him through faith in the Mediatour, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and that they ſhould ſtudy to be rather afflicted in ſpirit for ſin, then by performance of externall ceremonies, to pretend to it only, <hi>v.</hi> 13.— Unto this exhortation, two reaſons are ſubjoyned, the firſt whereof (in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 13.) is taken from the properties of God, who is merciful and gracious, not eaſily provoked, rich in kindneſſe, and who upon ſinners repentance, is ready to recall his threatenings that they be not executed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Were there never ſo many plagues on ſinners, yet God is not bound to take notice of them, ſo long as they repent not; And were there never ſo much terrour and affliction of ſpirit upon men, under feared or felt judgements; Yet all theſe ſerve to no purpoſe, if they ſtir not up to repentance: and they muſt be mad who being in ſuch a condition, yet do not ſet about that duty: Therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the repreſentation of plagues, and of terrour upon men, they are called to this as the only remedy and way to an iſſue, and as the duty which they cannot but minde who are ſeriouſly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch a condition; <hi>Therefore, turne ye.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.44.
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:114928:159"/>
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. 2. When God is threatening moſt ſadly, and proceeding moſt ſeverely, he would be ſtill underſtood, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting by theſe to repentance, and willing to accept of it, For, <hi>the Lord,</hi> who threatens, doth exhort, and he brings it in with a <hi>therefore,</hi> or upon the back of the former diſcourſe, to ſhew that this is his ſcope in all of it, <hi>Therefore, ſaith the Lord, Turne ye.</hi> 3. Such as have been ſo long abuſers of Gods patience, as matters ſeem irremediable, and ſtroakes are either imminent or incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, ſhould not for all that look upon the exerciſe of repentance as too late and out of ſeaſon, but ought to judge that it is good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then to ſet about it, and that it will do good however matters go: Therefore notwithſtanding they were in this ſad plight, yet the Lord exhorts them even <hi>now alſo</hi> to <hi>turne.</hi> 4 Such as do minde repentance, eſpecially when God declareth himſelf angry, would not linger nor delay to ſet about it; So much alſo may be imported in that <hi>now alſo</hi> they ſhould <hi>turn.</hi> 5. Whatever doubts ſuch as are humbled under judgements may have, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance will not be accepted; yet they are bound to anſwer all theſe from Gods naked Word who giveth the invitation to ſuch; Therefore is the exhortation given to ſuch in his Name, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all doubts, <hi>Turn ye, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 6. Repentance for particular ſins under ſad judgements, will neither be right nor acceptable, ſo long as men do not minde converſion to God, and a change of their ſtate by regeneration; that ſo the tree being good, the fruits may be anſwerable; Therefore doth he begin with <hi>turne ye to me;</hi> where the exhortation doth not import any power in man, but only points out his duty, and ſheweth that exhortation is a mean which God bleſſeth to his Elect, and not only deals thereby with them as with rational creatures, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with imparts ſtrength that they may obey. 7. In turning unto God, men would beware of being faint or feigned, but would ſtudy to be ſincere and ſingle, ſince they cannot attain to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; For, this in a Goſpel-ſenſe is to <hi>turn even to me with all your heart.</hi> 8. As men would begin at converſion to God, ſo they would therewith ſtudy to be deeply affected for ſin, and by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone evils, and under the judgements procured thereby; and would evidence their affliction of ſpirit, by ſorrow and humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuitable (in ſome meaſure) to their condition: Therefore is it added as an evidence and companion of the former, <hi>turn ye with faſting, and with weeping, and with mourning,</hi> or with ſuch ſorrow, as is uſual in mourning for the dead; and expreſſed not only by wailing, but by ſmiting on the breaſt, and the like ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures.
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:114928:159"/>
It is a change to be ſuſpected where men pleaſe themſelves with their preſent good condition, and do lightly paſſe over their former miſcarriages. And albeit ſignes and expreſſions of ſorrow be not alwayes at command when men are moſt afflicted, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for groſſe and long continued in iniquity, and under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary judgements, would not be paſt over in an ordinary and common way. 9. It is our duty in performing repentance, and a good evidence of it, when our ſtout hearts are broken and afflicted with the ſenſe of ſin, and of Gods diſpleaſure for it; Therefore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>and rent your heart,</hi> or every one his own heart, which is not to be underſtood literally, but that they ſhould be afflicted in ſpirit, as, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.17. 10. We are prone to hypocriſie, and ought to beware of dallying with God, even when we are in greateſt diſtreſſe, and making faireſt ſhewes of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; Therefore is it needful to qualifie this exhortation, <hi>rent your heart, and not your garments.</hi> 11. God is not pleaſed, nor will a true penitent be pleaſed with externall performances and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, neglecting ſubſtance; For, ſaith he, <hi>rent your heart, and not your garments.</hi> However they made frequent uſe of this ſigne in times of great ſorrow, (as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.34. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19. <hi>Job</hi> 1.20. and frequently,) yet God doth not allow of it when it is alone, or preferred to the other, (as is ſaid in another caſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.6.) though we are willing to do many things, rather then bow and afflict our hearts before God. 12. In all theſe exerciſes of repentance, we would again and again take heed that we deceive not our ſelves in the matter of our converſion, and pretend only to it till our particular diſtreſſe be removed; and though we finde our ſelves reall, yet we are to look on it as a work wherein we ſhould ſtill make progreſſe; Therefore after the former exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>v.</hi> 12. it is again ſubjoyned, <hi>and turn unto the Lord.</hi> As a matter whereof they ſhould be ſure, and grow in it, that they may go on in repentance. 13. Repentance and converſion would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be gone about in our own ſtrength, nor managed with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, nor any inherent change wrought in us, be reſted on as ſufficient to make up our peace with God. But our chief care ſhould be to embrace God by faith, as ours through Chriſt, and to draw ſtrength out of him for the duty, and by faith ſet againſt all our cruſhing diſcouragements, which may be ready to ariſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our affliction of ſpirit, and ſenſe of ſin; Therefore are they commanded in this repeated exhortation, <hi>turn unto the Lord your God,</hi> wherein all theſe are included. 14. Whatever the Lord be, or will ſay and do to the impenitent; yet there is nothing in him to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:114928:160"/>
be terrible to a convert and a penitent; And without the ſight of this, conviction, or contrition would but end in deſpare; Therefore notwithſtanding all the former threatenings, to this is ſubjoyned to the exhortation, by way of reaſon and encouragment, <hi>Turne ye, for he is gracious, &amp;c.</hi> 15. Theſe many encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taken from Gods properties, and put together, may teach, 1. How hard it is to raiſe up truly caſt down ſinners, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their diffidence, how preſumptuous ſoever they had been before. 2. It may teach what infinite fulneſſe (not eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) there is in God, to anſwer all the doubts and feares of a penitent. 3. It teacheth how willing the Lord is, that penitents be encouraged, as may be evidenced by his laying out that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of comfort that is in him, for that end. <hi>Doct.</hi> 16. Gods graciouſneſſe and readineſſe to ſhew mercy freely without our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, and his tender bowels of compaſſion and ſympathy, are ſuch as may aſſure the afflicted penitent, that he will be reſpected; And a ſerious ſtudy of this may invite ſinners to ſet about their duty in hope; For, <hi>Turne ye, for he is gracious and mercifull.</hi> 17. Gods long forbearance, and waiting for the repentance of ſinners before he ſtrike, albeit it may make the ſtroak ſad when it comes; yet it is an evidence and argument that he is willing to embrace a penitent, <hi>Turne ye, for he is ſlow to anger.</hi> 18. Gods great bounty and kindneſſe which is over all his works, and fills the earth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.5. may aſſure the penitent that he will meet with ſpecial kindneſſe, and with a liberal Lord and benefactour: So much doth the other property teach, he is <hi>of great kindneſſe,</hi> or <hi>bounty.</hi> 19. It needs not affright nor diſcourage the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that God hath denounced wrath againſt his ſin, and (it may be) hath begun to execute it; for he hath to do with a Lord who ſo delights in mercy, and is ſo affected with his peoples di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, that upon their repentance, he will willingly recall his ſentence from being executed, and withdraw his hand from ſtriking: For, ſo much is held out in this argument, <hi>he repenteth him of the evil,</hi> or changeth his dealing, as repenters uſe to do.</p>

                        <pb n="303" facs="tcp:114928:160"/>The ſecond reaſon of the exhortation, is, that as God is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in himſelf, ſo it is poſſible, and to be hoped that upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, he will avert the judgement ſo farre as the people ſhall ſubſiſt, and the publick worſhip not be altogether interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the famine; And that after theſe plagues are over, they ſhall have plenty. This phraſe of <hi>leaving a bleſſing behinde him;</hi> (or after theſe devourers are paſt by, and God paſt by with this his ſcourge and armie) is to be underſtood partly, that after every one of theſe have devoured in their courſe, as, <hi>chap</hi> 1.4. ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what may poſſibly be preſerved, for the peoples ſubſiſtence, and the publick worſhip: and partly, that after all theſe plagues are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, plenty may come. As for that doubtful phraſe; <hi>who knoweth, &amp;c?</hi> We may for further underſtanding of it, compare what is ſaid on <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.9. and <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When ſinners are moſt exerciſed in the duties of repentance, yet the true penitents hope is only fixed on God and his turning and change of dealing, and not on his own turning and repentance; for, ſo are penitents directed to look to Gods <hi>turning and repenting.</hi> 2. Albeit God will be certainly reconciled with ſinners upon their repentance and faith in Chriſt; And albeit God will mitigate his plagues unto penitents, at leaſt ſo far as that judgements are turned into father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chaſtiſements to them: Yet repentance will not alway hold off; or take off a temporal ſtroak, when either ſinne hath come to a great height, calling on God to vindicate his glory in puniſhing it, or when he would have the penitent yet more quickened up in his repentance, which readily he would fall ſlack in, if the rod were away. And albeit the Lord may intend to prevent or remove calamities, yet he will make the penitent more ſolicitous, diligent and humble, by keeping him in ſuſpence about it, for theſe cauſes it is, that there is ſo incertaine like a promiſe concerning their preſervation under, and iſſue from this rod, <hi>who knoweth if he will returne, &amp;c?</hi> 3. No incertainty about theſe things, ſhould diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage a penitent in his duty, as knowing that better promiſes are ſure enough to him; That Gods exerciſing him with incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is no evidence that he will not do even that for him, And that (however it go) he is in Gods way for attaining theſe things, as they may tend to his good; Therefore is he encouraged to repent upon this ſame, <hi>who knoweth if he will returne, &amp;c?</hi> 4. Outward benefits and meanes of plenty are in themſelves a bleſſing, however we abuſe them; They flow in their growth and preſervation from a rich bleſſing of influences; They do us good, becauſe God puts a bleſſing in them for that end; And
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:114928:161"/>
they are given to the penitent wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Gods correcting will not hinder his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to penitents, and there may be rich mercies waiting for them, both in the time of affliction, to make them ſubſiſt; and after them, to make them up: for, there is hope that, upon repentance, he will <hi>leave a bleſſing behinde him</hi> in both theſe reſpects, as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore explained. 6. As true penitents will be moſt affected with what concerneth God and his worſhip in times of calamities and will be encouraged when he holds up his publick worſhip and ordinances among them (whereby their intereſt in him is avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed) whatever become of their outward conditions So it gives ground of hope to penitents, that he hath an houſe and Ordinances among them, and therefore they ſhall ſubſiſt in trouble, till they come to an iſſue; Therefore it is added as a peculiar end of Gods leaving a bleſſing, even that there may <hi>be a meat-offering, and a drink offering unto the Lord your God.</hi> And this is added as a peculiar encouragement to the penitent who miſſed the comfort of publick worſhip, and as a ground of hope that he would give them meat, that ſo they might have wherewith to make oblations to him.</p>

callings for that end and time: and Miniſters ought to ſet this work on foot; for, the <hi>Prieſts are to blow the Trumpet in Zion,</hi> that there may be <hi>a faſt,</hi> and <hi>ſolemne aſſembly;</hi> or time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint from other imployments. 2. Care would be had both by Miniſters and people in their ſtations, that ſuch a duty be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely gone about, nor external formalities and performances reſted on; But that it may be performed in a ſpiritual and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied manner; And for this end, there ſhould be due preparation for it; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>ſanctifie a faſt, ſanctifie the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi> that is, when ye Prieſts intimate the faſt, ſtir them up to come prepared (as the word alſo ſignifieth) and purified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law that ſo they may faſt in a ſanctified manner. 3. Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick humiliations under calamites ſhould be univerſally joyned in by all, that all may concurre to quench the fire which their ſinnes have kindled, and every one may tremble to lie by in ſuch a need; Therefore is the command, <hi>Gather the people.</hi> 4. It is the duty of ſuch as are above others in age or authority, to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently active and examples unto others in times of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Therefore is there a peculiar command concerning them, <hi>Aſſemble the Elders,</hi> to acquit themſelves as becometh in this work, And by <hi>Elders</hi> we are not only to underſtand theſe that were in office, but even old men, as appeareth from the oppoſition of <hi>children, &amp;c.</hi> that is ſubjoyned. 5. Children and ſucking babes were brought out with the reſt, in ſolemne humiliations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, not becauſe they can repent, but, 1. That parents ſeeing their childrens affliction, might lay to heart their owne ſinnes, for which their babes are afflicted. 2. That love to their children, and care of their welfare might ſtir them up to repent. 3. That conſidering that their children had ſo much ſinne in themſelves, as juſtly made them obnoxious to theſe judgements; they might be led to ſee their owne provocations, to be farre more hainous. 4.

Yea, this place betwixt the porch and the Altar, was the place where Prophets (at leaſt ſuch as were of the Prieſts linage) preached unto the people; And ſo we finde <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah</hi> was ſlaine there in the exerciſe of his calling, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35. And ſo the meaning is only, that after ſolemne ſacrifices, they ſhould come to the publick and ordinary place, and there weep and pray with and for the people. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Miniſters ought to be eminently exemplar for ſenſe and diligence in times of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; And it is a part of their calling to be the mouth of the Lords people in publick prayers; wherein they are to expreſſe ſuch tenderneſſe and affection, as may witneſſe their ſenſe of the publike condition, and may be an example and means of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirring the people: for, <hi>let the Prieſts, the Miniſters of the Lord, weep between the porch and the Altar, and let them ſay, &amp;c.</hi> 2. The humble penitent hath no refuge left him, but God and his mercie only; And he is allowed to lay hold on this, when he hath no other claime; for they are warranted to ſay, <hi>Spare, O Lord,</hi> which is an act flowing from mercie withdrawing and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating

deſerved judgements. 3. Intereſt in God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity and unchangeableneſſe thereof, is not to be quited by the penitent, but to be made uſe of as a ground of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Reproach is a ſad addition to the calamities of Gods people, and an argument why God will pitie, when the reproached are penitent, and come to him with it; Therefore are they to make uſe of this alſo, <hi>give not thine heritage to reproach,</hi> that is, do not, by thy diſpenſations, expoſe them to the inſolent ſcorne of the Heathen, who are wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſuch an advantage. 5. It is alſo an argument of pitie, and ground of pleading to the penitent, that enemies are lying at wait to take advantage of their diſtreſſe, and that trouble may drive them on tentations, and put them to hard ſhifts; Therefore is it pleaded as another inconvenient following on their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trouble, <hi>that the Heathen ſhould rule over them.</hi> Which though ſome read it (as an explication of that reproach) <hi>to uſe a by-word againſt them:</hi> yet as it is tranſlated, it ſignifieth that their want did not only give the Heathen occaſion of reproach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, but they might be ready alſo to take advantage of their weakneſſe, to invade them. And they might be ready to ſell themſelves into bondage to get meat, or to wander among the Heathen as, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.1. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.1, 5. And therefore, they pray that God wouſd prevent this. 6. Affliction will be yet ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the penitent, when it ſeemeth to reflect on God and his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as if he were not willing or able to ſupply his people: And this reproaching of God, is an argument of pitie, eſpecially when it becometh the penitents affliction; for, it is another ground of pleading, that <hi>they ſay among the people, Where is their God?</hi> and that they are affected with this, as a chief ingredient in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, <hi>Wherefore ſhould they ſay among the people, Where is their God?</hi>

                     <p>In this <hi>verſe</hi> we have the firſt promiſe, wherein they are aſſured that upon their repentance, Gods affection toward them and their land ſhall appear in compaſſion and pity, as the cauſe of ſtaying further vengeance, and of the bleſſings following. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Penitents will undoubtedly finde good acceptance at Gods hand, whatever their deſervings have been; for, upon their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what is enjoyned before, it is ſubjoyned, <hi>then will the Lord be jealous.</hi> 2. Penitents are allowed to plead an intereſt in God, and will be owned and confirmed in ſo doing, by God; for, whereas they had pleaded themſelves <hi>thy people, v.</hi> 17. now the Lord confirmeth that, declaring that they are <hi>his people.</hi> 3. Gods people are not only dear to him being penitents; but all their enjoyments and concernments will be reſpected for their ſakes, and as coming to them by Covenant; for, not only his people, but their lands diſtreſſe is conſidered, as being <hi>his land,</hi> given them by Covenant. Which though it was true of the promiſed land in a peculiar way; Yet it is ſtill of general verity, that the Lord hath a ſpecial reſpect to what belongs to penitents. 4. A roome in Gods affection is the firſt and chief mercy conferred on penitents; for, it is here the firſt promiſe, from whence all the reſt do flow, 5. Affection in God toward his people, and their enjoyments for their ſake, will do whatſoever can be expected from marriage or parental affection in diſtreſſe; His affliction will reſent injuries done to them, as an husband doth in behalfe of his wife, and will pitied ſtreſſe, and upon that, will ſpare, as the word imports; for, <hi>the Lord will be jealous for his land, and pitie his people.</hi> See <hi>Pſal</hi> 103.13. <hi>His jealouſie for the land,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to what is ſaid of its being married, <hi>Iſa</hi> 63.4.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:114928:163"/>
learn,</hi> 1. God will prove his affection to penitents by reall effects, and may anſwer them in the very particular which they ſeeke, when it good for them; And particularly, he may give plenty to them, to let them ſee that piety is the ſhorteſt cut, even to do well, outwardly; for ſo much is held out in this promiſe ſubjoyned to the former, wherein he ſatisfieth their deſire, and evidenceth his jealouſie and pitie. <hi>I will ſend you corne, and wine, and oile.</hi> 2. Mercies unto penitents and ſupplicants are twice mercies, both in themſelves, and in that they are the anſwer of prayers, and do evidence his love to them, and intereſt in them; for ſo this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cometh, <hi>the Lord will anſwer and ſay,</hi> and that <hi>unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> 3.

Penitents get their mercies firſt by promiſe, that ſo their faith may be tried, and they may have the advantage of ſpiritual exerciſe, even about tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral favours; And that the mercie, when it cometh, may be ſo much the ſweeter unto them: Therefore is their plenty firſt held out in a promiſe, <hi>I will ſend,</hi> (or, <hi>I am ſending) you corne, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Penitents mercies will be ſatisfactorie, by their getting abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them, or a bleſſing with what they get, and by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and quiet of minde with what they enjoy, which the ſimple favour of it ſelf could not produce, for, <hi>and ye ſhall be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therewith.</hi> 6. As reproach is a very ſad affliction, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it ariſeth upon Gods hard dealing, giving occaſion to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to be inſolent; So however the Lord will ſmite his impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent people, and ſee to his own glory another way; Yet in due time, he will take away the viſible marks of his diſpleaſure from penitents, and ſo remove the occaſion of their reproach; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, albeit before this time, he had juſtly given them over to the ſad trial of reproach, yet now he promiſeth, <hi>I will no more make you a repraach among the heathen.</hi>

                     <p>Theſe promiſes are (for more aſſurance and comfort) applied and amplified. And firſt, application is made to the land, that it ſhould not fear, but rejoyce, ſeeing God was to do great things; and to the beaſts, that they ſhould lay aſide their fear, ſince the earth was to be bleſſed with paſture and fruit. This ſpeaking to the land and beaſts doth not import them capable, but God by this would ſpeak to the comfort of the penitent; And it teacheth, 1, The Lord would have his promiſes and comforts applied by them to whom they are given, for their refreſhment; So much doth this application of the former promiſes import. 2. Gods kindneſſe to penitents will be ſuch, as not only to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but to gladden and refreſh their land, their beaſts, and all in their kinde; for, ſo is held out here. 3. Penitents are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to draw down bleſſings on themſelves, and on what they enjoy; for, now the <hi>mourning land,</hi> ch. 1.10. and the <hi>crying beaſts,</hi> ch. 1.18, 20. are made to <hi>rejoyce.</hi> 4. Gods care of the earth, and of very cattel may aſſure penitents of his reſpects to them; If he reſpect the lands affliction, and the beaſts, how much more theirs? See <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.26, 30. 5. God when he pleaſeth, can make fears end in joy, and the hope thereof ſhould bring joy, when fear is yet on; for, ſo much is held out in the command to the land, <hi>Fear not, be glad and rejoyce,</hi> and that in hope. 6. Gods great power who promiſeth, and who hath given proof thereof in executing threatenings, may guard againſt fear, and afford ground of hope, were the thing promiſed never ſo great and difficult; for, ſo is held forth in the reaſon of joy that <hi>the Lord</hi> (who had done great things by that Army, <hi>v.</hi> 20.) <hi>will do great things.</hi> 7. God can, and in due time will remove the feares of his people, by giving actual proofes of his love; for, ſo are they encouraged by the promiſe made to the beaſts for their ſake and good, <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>Be not afraid, ye beaſts of the field: for the paſtures of the wilderneſſe do ſpring, &amp;c.</hi>

Whoever miſſe of joy, yet God will have his penitent Church and people to rejoyce; and they are allowed to have as much and as ſolid joy as any, and more; Therefore are <hi>the children of Zion</hi> called to it. 2. The Lord muſt not only afford matter of joy and comfort to his people, but muſt ſpeak and apply it to their heart, and ſtir them up to rejoyce in it before it work: Therefore is this exhortation and application needful, <hi>Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoyce.</hi> 3. Common favours and benefits, ſhould be unto the Lords people, but as a ſtep leading them up to rejoyce in God, and not to be reſted on themſelves; Therefore, though the promiſe be of plenty, yet they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in <hi>the Lord their God,</hi> and becauſe of a ſpecial intereſt in him. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.23, 24. <hi>Luke</hi> 10.19, 20. 4. Common fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours given ſo a people upon repentance, do warrant them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God as evidencing his reſpect unto them, and intereſt in them, even by theſe; For, ſo the penitents here, are upon this promiſe commanded, <hi>rejoyce in the Lord your God.</hi> 5. As man needs many things for his ſubſiſtence, and for furniſhing the meanes thereof, (as raine at ſeveral ſeaſons to make the earth fruitful;) So the Lords meaſuring and timing of outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:114928:165"/>
is that which makes them mercies indeed; for, though <hi>rain</hi> be needful, yet it is the bleſſing of it, that he giveth it <hi>moderately,</hi> and that he ſends <hi>the former raine, and the latter raine in the firſt moneth,</hi> which was the ſeaſon, as appeareth, of the latter rain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which it is not needful to make further inquiry. Only what is here ſaid of raine holds good in all outward mercies, that it is the great advantange of Saints, that the diſpoſing of them is in the hand of their only wiſe Lord. 6. Promiſing mercies will not prove unuſeful, nor diſappoint the expectation of penitents, as the Lord in juſtice deals often with the wicked; For, as mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſeaſonable rain promiſeth a good harveſt, ſo it ſhall prove ſo, <hi>the floores ſhall be full of wheat, and the fats ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow with oile.</hi> 7. The Lord can, and will make up the loſſes of penitents; And when ever ſinners do turne to God, he will convince them in due time, that they have been no loſers by their afflictions: of this truth we have a particular proof and inſtance in this promiſe, <hi>and I will reſtore to you the years that the locuſt hath eaten, &amp;c.</hi> 8. Our ſeeing of God and his hand in ſaddeſt ſcourges and loſſes, will aſſure us that he can ſoon and eaſily make them up; For, ſaith he, they were <hi>my great army which I ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you,</hi> and if he ſent them, and made them able to make ſuch havoke, then certainly he can not only remove them, but ſend as remarkable plenty.</p>

                     <p>Theſe promiſes and cauſes of their joy are amplified from ſome effects. As, 1. That they ſhall have the uſe of this plenty to their ſatisfaction. 2. That they ſhall praiſe God for it. 3. That by this his dealing, and his other mercies toward them, he will convince them of his relation to them, who is God only; and will confirme them and all the godly, that they ſhall never be
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:114928:166"/>
diſappointed of their hope in him; which he aſſerts twice for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmation. And this is the firſt ſpiritual promiſe, whereby he encourageth them to repent. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is an addition to the mercy of plenty, when men are allowed the uſe of creatures to ſatisfaction, without challenge of conſcience, and are not denied a bleſſing upon, and with them, nor are others permitted to take them away after they are growen up; as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.8. For, it is a promiſe, <hi>Ye ſhall eat in plenty, and be ſatisfied.</hi> 2. It is the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch as receive the good things of this life, to make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thankfulneſſe to God, whoſe providence ſupplieth their wants; And true penitents, and ſuch as are turned to God, will make conſcience of this duty, conſidering (eſpecially) that theſe common favours come to them in ſpecial love, and from their own God in Covenant with them; Therefore it is added to their eating and ſatisfaction, <hi>and ſhall praiſe the Name of the LORD your God.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.8, 9. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.10. 3. It is our duty to ſtir up our ſelves to praiſe in this, by conſidering the wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the providence of God in providing continually our daily bread: And eſpecially in his ſending great plenty after famine, in which change of dealing, both his providence and mercy ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; For, it is added as an argument of praiſe, that he <hi>hath dealt wonderouſly with you,</hi> both in his ordinary providence, and eſpecially in that great change. 4. The chief bleſſing and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of temporal benefits unto the godly, is, that by receiving and uſing of them, they reap ſome ſpiritual benefit and advantage by confirmation of their faith, and diſcovering of the love of God unto them; ſo much are we taught by ſubjoyning this ſpiritual promiſe, containing an effect of conferring this temporal favour. 5. Gods dealing kindly with his Church, or any one of them, in any particular according to the Covenant, may be a pledge that none, be who they will, that are his people, will ever finde it in vaine to ſeek him, or be aſhamed or diſappointed of their hope in him according to his Word; For, this is a general concluſion drawn from this particular proof of his love, <hi>and my people ſhall never be aſhamed.</hi> 6. An intereſt in God by vertue of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and his manifeſted preſence following upon that, is the choice of mercies; And it is ſweet when this maybe read and ſeen ſhining in his mercies, as a penitent is allowed to do; For, it is held out as the ſweet effect and conſequent of his bounty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward penitents, <hi>ye ſhall know,</hi> not only <hi>that I am the Lord your God,</hi> but that he hath not withdrawn himſelf, though the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtand, but <hi>that I am in the midſt of Iſrael,</hi> or theſe who are
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:114928:166"/>
now left of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be a people to him. And however the Lord here promiſeth proſperity to evidence this; yet if the Lord clear it any other way, it is ſufficient. 7. It is alſo a great addition to the Churches mercy, that he who alone is her God, is alſo the only true God; and therefore is the only portion, and above all the oppoſition that can be made to her felicity; For, <hi>I am the Lord your God, and none elſe,</hi> none beſide him to prove a God unto her, let her chooſe never ſo many. 8. However the people of God may be oft put to pray againſt that ſad affliction of being aſhamed of their confidence, as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.116. Yet it is to be believed, and again and again inculcate, that not only now, but for ever, Gods people have no cauſe of fearing diſappontment; &amp; that God will by actual performance of his promiſes, put them from all cauſe of fear; Therefore in oppoſition to the recurring of ſuch tentations, it is again repeated, <hi>and my people ſhall never be aſhamed.</hi> Where it is given them as a ground of hope, that God who chooſeth and calleth them to be his peculiar people, will not raiſe ſuch an ill report upon his own love, or ſervice, as thus to entertain them; Nor will he make his own purpoſe and grace in election and calling void, albeit they be worthleſſe.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond ſpirituall promiſe is, that under Chriſt and in the dayes of the Goſpel, (as it is expounded, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) he will poure out his Spirit more amply then before, upon all ſorts of perſons of all Nations, both old and young, ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, bond and free, whereby they ſhall be endued with ſuch knowledge of the myſteries of ſalvation, as may be compared with the knowledge of the ancient Prophets. For clearing this a little, Conſider, 1. By the <hi>Spirit</hi> here promiſed, is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:114928:167"/>
any natural or moral endowments conferred upon men; But partly, the ſpiritual common gifts conferred upon men for the edification of the Church; And partly, the ſaving graces of the Spirit conferred upon the Elect in order to their eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 2. By <hi>all fleſh,</hi> on whom the Spirit is to be poured out, we are not to underſtand all and every one; for this promiſe is made only to theſe within the Church, and to theſe who (at leaſt) by viſible Covenant become the Lords, as it is expounded of the ſervants and handmaids, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.18. But it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of all ſorts of perſons of whatſoever Nation of theſe who embrace Chriſt; and that there ſhould be many of them, in compariſon of the times under the Law, who ſhould participate either of the gifts or graces of the Spirit, or of both. 3. As for the effects of the pouring out of the Spirit here mentioned, that there ſhall be <hi>prophecies, dreams and viſions;</hi> it is true, that in that ſignal accompliſhment of this promiſe. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and afterward in theſe primitive times, there were ſuch extraordinary wayes of manifeſtation of God and of his will; for many did prophecie then, even women, as is inſtanced in the daughters of <hi>Philip, Acts</hi> 21.9. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had viſions. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 10.10, 11. And God appeared to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in a dream, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. But this was but a partial accompliſhment of this promiſe, and a mean to carry on the full accompliſhment therof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to conceive that the Prophet ſpeaks of Goſpel-times and mercies, in tearmes borrowed from the times of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; and the meaning is, that as of old the excellent way and meaſure of the knowledge of God was by prophecie, viſion, and dreams, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12.6. So under the New Teſtament, beſide what was extraordinary, all who get the Spirit of God, may for knowing the myſteries of ſalvation, be compared with theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets. And as of old by theſe wayes of manifeſtation, men attained to the knowledge of the myſteries of God; ſo ſhould they by the Spirit of God, in the uſe of ordinary means. 4. This may alſo ſerve to clear, that the Prophet is not foretelling that, under the Goſpel, all who receive the Spirit and know the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſalvation thereby, are therefore warranted to exercie the office of Prophets or Miniſters; For, Prophecie being ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, is not given to all upon whom the Spirit is poured out, as is clear from, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29. 5. It is alſo clear that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is not here ſpeaking of any revelations to be given unto men, without or beſide the Word, or which are not to be tried thereby;
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:114928:167"/>
for, (beſide what is alrerdy ſaid for expoſition of this promiſe,) if we look to the moſt ſolemne and ſignal accompliſhment of this promiſe, we will finde the conceit refuted. For in the very firſt Sermon of <hi>Peter</hi> after the Spirit is poured out, he leads the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers all along to Scripture, both to juſtifie the ſtrange change wrought upon them, and to juſtifie the doctrine which being thus endowed, he preacheth, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16, 17, 25, 30, 31, 34. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The times of the Goſpel are the times of letting out ſpiritual encouragements, and wherein men ought to be more ſpiritual, and made up with ſpiritual advantages, however it go with them out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; Therefore the Prophet entering upon ſpiritual promiſes and refreſhments, after theſe temporal promiſes, for the comfort of this people, doth remit them to what <hi>ſhall come to paſſe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> or <hi>in the laſt dayes,</hi> as it is expounded, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.17. 2. The Lords letting out of his Spirit in gifts and ſpiritual graces, is the great Goſpel-refreſhment and encouragement; as making the myſteries of God known, and applying all Chriſts purchaſe to Believers; So that all who would finde the advantage of the times of the Goſpel, ought to ſeek much of the Spirit; for, this is the promiſe, <hi>I will poure out my Spirit.</hi> 3. The letting out of the Spirit, is God and his Son Chriſts free promiſe and gift, and therefore to be ſought of him, and expected from him by theſe who are in themſelves unworthy; For, it is a promiſe, <hi>I will poure out my Spirit,</hi> which Chriſt did performe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. See <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. 4. Albeit the Spirit of God was communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto the Church under the Law; yet it is the advantage of the times of the Goſpel, 1. That the Spirit is let forth in more ample meaſure then formerly, being <hi>poured out</hi> largely, and not dropped out only: So that we may ſeek largely, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with little, nor be ſtraitened in our own bowels. 2. That this gift is not reſtricted now to one Nation of the Jewes with their proſelytes, and but to a few of them; but is free to all ſorts of perſons and Nations, and to many of them; For, it is <hi>upon all fleſh</hi> the Spirit is poured out. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Whatever be the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant meaſure of the Spirit that is poured out; yet there is ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more in God to communicate, as need requireth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>Peter, Act.</hi> 2.17. expound it, <hi>I will poure out of my Spirit,</hi> or but ſome portion of that fulneſſe that is in him, Which is not only true in reſpect of Chriſt, who hath the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. but alſo in reſpect of the infinite fulneſſe that is in God. 6. God, in pouring out his Spirit, will not diſdain
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:114928:168"/>
men becauſe of their frailty, or felt ſinfulneſſe: And where the Spirit is given, it will keep men ſtill ſenſible of their condition, and what they are in themſelves; Therefore are they deſigned <hi>fleſh,</hi> or, fraile and ſinful creatures, upon whom the Spirit is to be poured out, ſhewing that their being ſuch, doth not hinder his bounty; and his bounty will not make them forget that they are ſuch. 7. It is a ſpecial advantage reaped by the enjoyment of the Spirit, that not only doth he water and refreſh, and fructifie the barren ſpirits of theſe in whom he dwels, (and therefore is ſaid to be <hi>poured out</hi> like water on the ground. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3.) But that alſo he doth illuminate men with the knowledge of God; He doth make known the myſteries of ſalvation, furniſheth inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to carry the glad tydings of ſalvation, leads into all truth, and maketh knowen the things that we have freely received: Therefore doth he cauſe to <hi>propheſie,</hi> and to <hi>dream dreams, &amp;c.</hi> as is before explained. See <hi>John</hi> 16.13. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 8. and 2.12, to 15. 8. The knowledge of the myſteries of ſalvation, which is communicated by the Spirit under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, is comparable to any meaſure of knowledge attained by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets of old: Not only doth extraordinary revelation under the New Teſtament in the primitive times, parralel what they had then; But even the gifts of light and knowledge, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in ordinary upon men, and the ſaving knowledge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Believers, may be compared therewith; for whereas theſe revelations were but at fits and times only, this is conſtant; and theſe, albeit they were ſingular in the manner of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, yet the truth conveighed thereby, was but more darkly held out, and under a vaile, whereas now truths are ſeen with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen face; Therefore as is before cleared, are the names of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, viſions</hi> and <hi>dreams,</hi> given to this knowledge. So that the ignorance of men under the Goſpel, doth ſpeak but little enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit. 9. Whereas he is not content to ſay only in general, that <hi>all fleſh</hi> ſhall receive of the Spirit, but doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it in <hi>ſons and daughters, old men and young, ſervants and handmaids;</hi> It may teach, 1. No rank, or ſex or condition of perſons are ſecluded from the promiſe of the Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e they old or young, male or female, bond or free. 2. The efficacy and fulneſſe of the Spirit of God is ſuch, as to refreſh and prevaile with all theſe ſorts of perſons; young ones who are not capable of mans teaching, yet are not ſecluded from his teaching, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.14, 16. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.15. The Spirit hath vertue to illuminate and ſubdue
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:114928:168"/>
young men, notwithſtanding all the power of their corruptions, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13, 14. to keep men freſh and lively in old age, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.13, 14. and to make ſervants happy in their condition, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.22. 3. It is Gods ſure promiſe to the Church of the Goſpel, that the knowledge of him, and of his truth, ſhall be continued and propagated therein from generation to generation; For, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it put in the firſt place, <hi>your ſons and daughters,</hi> (riſing up to ſucceed you) <hi>ſhall propheſie. Doct.</hi> 10. As for theſe wayes of revealing the will of God of old, by <hi>prophecie, viſions and dreams,</hi> albeit they point all at one thing, and ſeem to be named all here, to let out the fulneſſe of Goſpel-knowledge, anſwering to all of them; and therefore ſeem to be comprehended all under <hi>propheſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as it is attributed to his ſervants of all ſorts and ages, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.18. Yet ſeeing they are diſtinctly named, and attributed to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of perſons, as <hi>propheſying</hi> to ſons and daughters, <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to young men, and <hi>dreames</hi> to old men; We may from it take up ſome ſteps and degrees of the knowledge of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they grow up who are under the Spirits teaching. As, 1. By <hi>propheſying</hi> attributed to <hi>ſons and daughters,</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſimply the knowledge of divine things. 2. By <hi>viſions</hi> attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to <hi>young men,</hi> we may underſtand their clearer inſight, and uptaking of theſe myſteries, then they had in their younger dayes: For viſion doth repreſent the thing revealed more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly. 3. By <hi>dreams,</hi> wherein men have their ſenſes ſhut up from the world, and which are attributed to <hi>old men,</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a further degree of illumination, when light received doth take hold on the affections, to ſanctifie and ſubdue them; So that mens hearts are taken off the world, and filled with the things of God. And ſo this gradation will teach, That the knowledge of God which is communicated unto men by the Spirit, will be on the growing hand, till from a common notion and remembring of it, it come to be more ſeriouſly pondered and laid to heart, and till it take hold upon the affections, and conquer the whole heart to God.</p>

Satan will bend all his power to oppoſe the progreſſe of the Goſpel, and will ſet the world in oppoſition to the Church; and on the other hand, God will poure out all ſorts of calamities upon the viſible
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:114928:169"/>
Church, to puniſh them who contemne his rich offer, and do not walk anſwerably to ſuch diſpenſations; and to trie the graces of his own, that they may aſpire toward ſpiritual happineſſe in heaven: And he will puniſh ſecret and open enemies, for the injuries they do to the Church; For theſe cauſes is this predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſubjoyned to the former promiſe. 2. It is the Churches du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not only to look for troubles, but to expect that they will be great and very dreadful, ſuch as may teſtifie the greatneſſe of Gods diſpleaſure againſt ſin, and of mens fury againſt the Church, ſuch as may throughly trie the godly, and bring about Gods deep counſels: For, there will be <hi>wonders in the heavens,</hi> (or, the firmament and ſeveral regions of the aire,) <hi>and in the earth, blood and fire, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Whoever be employed in raiſing theſe great commotions, and whatever be the deſignes and malice of men in them; yet it is the Churches good and ſafety, to ſee a ſupreme hand of God in all of them; For, ſaith he, <hi>I will ſhew won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp;c.</hi> 4. Though the Church in ſeveral ages, may get times of breathing and tranquillity, yet theſe will not be perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but interrupted with ſad blaſts, till the ſecond coming of Chriſt, which as it is certainly approaching, ſo it will put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to all ſtormes wherewith the godly are toſſed; For, theſe things will be <hi>before the great and terrible day of the Lord come,</hi> that is, in all ages till that time, and belike very violently immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.29, 30. 5.

This he confirmeth in a generall promiſe, that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> called of God, there ſhall be deliverance according to Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, or ſome remnant to eſcape, to preſerve a people to God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and at laſt to inherit ſalvation. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Were the condition of the viſible Church, or of the world never ſo deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and deſperate; yet it ſhould not drive men from God, his truth and pure worſhip, but rather make them cleave to it more, and evidence this by frequent and earneſt calling on him; For, this is the duty required under theſe calamities, <hi>to call on the Name of the LORD,</hi> under which is comprehended all outward and inward worſhip of God, (whereof this is a chief part,) and mens cleaving to it. 2. As God is able to ſave in greateſt extremities; ſo he will undoubtedly ſave and deliver them who cleave to him, and ſeek him, be of what Nation or people they will. He will either hide ſome of them from trouble in great tempeſts, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them under it, till he give an iſſue from it here, or here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and at laſt will compleatly ſave them; For, <hi>whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the LORD, ſhall be delivered,</hi> or <hi>eſcape.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.13. 3. The Church is the place of greateſt ſafety, and where deliverance may moſt readily be expected of any; and however it fare with particular perſons in times of commotions; yet the Lord will ſtill preſerve a Church and remnant in the world, yea even a remnant of <hi>Jewes,</hi> till their full converſion; The efore ſaith he, <hi>for in mount Zion and in Jeruſalem ſhall he deliverance, and in the remnant,</hi> Where he names <hi>Zion and Jeruſalem,</hi> not only as a type of the Church, wherein ſafety is to be found, and the remnant are to be preſerved, but to point out
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:114928:170"/>
that of the <hi>Jewes</hi> belonging to theſe places, he would keep ſtill a remnant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.5. till that day come whereof he ſpeaks in the next Chapter. 4. God hath paſt his word for the preſervation of a remnant under trouble, and this is to be truſted to, whatever our ſenſe ſay to the contrary: For, ſaith he, there <hi>ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, as the Lord hath ſaid,</hi> frequently in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. 5. As the true Church is but a remnant in compariſon of the reſt of the world; So times of trouble cutting off ſome, and tempting others to Apoſtaſie, may draw them to a very ſmall number, who cleave to God, and ſhall partake of promiſed ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Therefore it is added by way of explication, that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> ſhall be <hi>in the remnant,</hi> or among them, though ſome of them eſcape not the ſtroak of trouble. 6. It is Gods effectual calling and election of grace that makes a difference among men, and makes them ſeek and cleave to him; And this is alſo a pledge that he who hath called and ingaged them in that ſervice, will give them deliverance, and an iſſue from it: Therefore, it is added both by way of reaſon how it cometh there is a remnant, and by way of confirmation that they ſhall be delivered, they are <hi>the remnant whom the Lord ſhall call.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.4, 5, 6, 7. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.24.</p>

                     <p>Albeit this Verſ. doth expreſſely hold out only the time of Gods ſentencing and puniſhing <hi>Judahs</hi> enemies, of which he ſpeaks in the following purpoſe: Yet it doth import further, 1. That there was to come a captivity and diſperſion of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, both in City and Countrey, and that under the Goſpel, and after the pouring out of the Spirit, of which <hi>ch.</hi> 2.28. for all the enſuing predictions do follow upon that. It hath been already declared that after the performance of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, great troubles were to follow, <hi>ch.</hi> 2.30, 31. and that in the midſt of theſe troubles, not only ſhould the truly godly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to eternal ſalvation, by cleaving to God and his Worſhip, but the Lord ſhould preſerve a remnant for himſelf, who ſhould eſcape theſe troubles, <hi>v.</hi> 32. And this (as the connexion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and hath been ſaid before,) is but a confirmation and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance given of that general promiſe, in the caſe of the Jewes. So that it cannot at all relate to the captivity of <hi>Babylon.</hi> 2. It imports, that a reſtitution and returne of their captivity was to follow upon their diſperſion, at which time he will performe what is after ſpoken of. And this is the firſt promiſe which is made to <hi>Judah,</hi> as a pledge of the ſpiritual deliverance of his Church, and all his people, and of temporal deliverance alſo, in ſo far as it is needed. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord giveth general grounds of encouragement from his Wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d, he is able to inſtruct and make them good by particular evidences of his love, to the conſciences of his own; Therefore having given that generall promiſe, <hi>ch.</hi> 2.32. he doth here ſubjoyn a particular and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence thereof, <hi>For I will bring again the captivity of Judah.</hi> 2. Gods diſpenſations toward his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether in mercy or judgement, are very admirable; And men ought (inſtead of their ſleepineſſe, careleſſeneſſe and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment when great things are in doing) to ſtir up themſelves to obſerve them much. Therefore is a <hi>Behold</hi> prefixed to this (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their captivity is ſuppoſed, and their reſtitution promiſed,) and to what further ſhall be done at that time. 3.

mercies manifeſted to the Church, may be ſeconded with ſaddeſt outward afflictions, even with captivity and reſtraint of liberty, driving them from their intereſts and acquaintance, and putting them under the power of others; And that (as for other reaſons, ſo) becauſe they contemne and make no uſe of theſe ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies: For, ſo is imported here, that after Chriſt came in the fleſh to the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the Spirit was poured out among them, yet becauſe they deſpiſed and oppoſed all this, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a <hi>captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem.</hi> 4. Deliverance and reſtitution according to the tenour of the Covenant, will certainly follow upon the captivity of the Lords people, even to admiration and the aſtoniſhment of all: And particularly <hi>Judah's</hi> ſecond and long captivity will have a remarkable iſſue: For, <hi>Behold, I ſhall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi>

The time of performing this promiſe being propounded, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. We have here further, 1. The convocation of theſe enemies, and the bringing of them to judgement; Their conſpiring againſt the Church, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> about the time of their converſion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection, ſhall be the Lords work to gather them to the place of judgement and execution of vengeance. 2. The place of judgement is here called <hi>the valley of Jehoſhaphat,</hi> which ſome
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:114928:172"/>
take for ſome valley lying in view of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to intimate that theſe enemies may ſurround the Church, and bring her into great ſtraits, before that Gods iſſue come. (as, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9.) And that the execution of this vengeance will be in view of the Church, to her full ſatisfaction and contentment, when her eyes ſhall ſee her deſire upon her enemies. But it rather ſeemes to point at that valley, where <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> got that notable deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.22,—26. And albeit it were needleſſe curioſity to determine that that ſame ſhould be the place of this notable judgement and execution; yet the alluſion intimates, that the plague on theſe enemies ſhould be like that which befell <hi>Edom</hi> and his confederates then, when the Lord ſtirred them up to ſlay one another, and they became a prey to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> The word alſo being taken appellatively, doth ſignifie <hi>the valley of Gods judgement,</hi> and ſo it will be, let the particular place be where it will. 3. We have the forme of procedure which (that the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and equity of the judgment may appear the more) is ſet down by way of judicial proceſſe, wherein God the Judge doth plead the cauſe of his people againſt them, to <hi>v.</hi> 7. giveth out ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. and ſeeth it executed, <hi>v</hi> 9,— 16.— In theſe Verſes, we have Gods pleading againſt all theſe enemies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for their ſcattering his hereditary people, their parting the land that was proper to him, and for that, with cruelty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, they divided his people and children by lot among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be ſo many ſlaves, and gave boyes and girles to ſatisfie their luſts. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God will not only reſtore and deliver his people, but will give them a ſeen and ſatisfactory amends for all the wrongs they have received from men, and will make the time of their reſtitution, prove ſad dayes to enemies: So much doth the connexion of this with the former Verſe teach, <hi>in that time when I ſhall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem, I will alſo gather all Nations, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Albeit that enemies will be on foot, when ever God appears for his people, and particularly at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and recollection of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to oppoſe and bear them down; Yet God will not only fruſtrate their deſignes, but will bring his own purpoſes to paſſe by their enterprizes: For, the Nations gathering of themſelves to oppoſe the Church, is Gods gathering them to judgement, <hi>I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ll gather all Nations, and bring them down, &amp;c.</hi> 3. Albeit they are not few, but many who do conſpire againſt the Church on all occaſions, and will gather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the converſion of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> yet their multitude will not
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:114928:173"/>
make Gods purpoſes void; For, <hi>I will gather</hi> even <hi>all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c.</hi> 4. God hath even the very place prepared and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained in his counſel, wherein he will plead with, and execute vengeance upon enemies, and wherein he will manifeſt his juſtice and power, and his love to his people as of old. Therefore doth he point at the place, putting them in minde of what he had done of old, and aſſuring them of his righteous judgement, to be executed on their behalf, <hi>I will bring them down into the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of Jehoſhaphat.</hi> 5. The injuries done to the Church are ſuch as God will certainly plead with men for, albeit none elſe ſhould regard them; and he will ſo revenge their quarrel as equity and juſtice ſhall ſhine in it; For, <hi>I will plead with them there for my people.</hi> And albeit his pleading here be by ſtroakes, yet he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it the name of <hi>pleading,</hi> and frameth a proceſſe, to ſhew how conſpicuous his juſtice ſhall be in that procedure. 6. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it Gods people be in themſelves worthleſſe, yet his intereſt in them is ſufficient ground of hope that he will plead againſt their enemies; And albeit his dealing ſeem oft-times to obſcure this intereſt, yet he will again make it conſpicuous, and prove it by his pleading for them; yea, whatever he have to ſay againſt them, yet he will never lay aſide this intereſt when he pleads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt enemies, but will recompence them as if his people had never provoked him: In all theſe reſpects this is their title when he pleads for them, <hi>I will plead with them for my people, and for my heritage.</hi> His intereſt will make him plead, and he will prove them to be ſo by pleading, and he will not deal with enemies as plaguing a ſinful people, (as. <hi>Jer.</hi> 50 7.) but as oppreſſing his people. 7. Albeit that in Chriſt Jeſus there is neither <hi>Jew</hi> nor <hi>Greek,</hi> but Chriſt is all in all; and albeit that <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> be now rejected, as a Nation, and enemies for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſake: yet not only are they ſtill beloved, as touching the election, and the gifts and calling of God toward them, without repentance; <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28, 29. But in due time, God will make them become an hereditary people unto him, as a Nation under the ſtate of the Goſpel, whereby he will revive their ancient right to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; For, in that day of their converſion, he will plead for them as his people and heritage, <hi>for my people, and for my heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Iſrael.</hi> 8. The preſent enemies of the people of God are the true heires and ſucceſſours of their former enemies, and therefore muſt pay for all their cruelties and oppreſſions; Therefore in that day will he reckon with them who ſhall then conſpire againſt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:114928:173"/>
them, as if they had lived in former times, and had captivated and ſcattered them, becauſe they do then oppoſe them, and hinder their reſtitution. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.34, 35. 9. Such as the Lord chooſeth to be his people, both they and their intereſts are dear to him, and are his in a peculiar manner, for reſpect and protection, and for aſſerting thereof out of the hands of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours; Therefore not only are they <hi>my people,</hi> and their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſented, but the land is <hi>my land,</hi> he will aſſert his right to what belongs to them, when they cannot proſecute their own right. 10. Scattering of the people of God, and eſpecially the diſſipation of their Church-ſociety, is a quarrel which the Lord will not forget, when he pleads with enemies; For, it is laid to their charge, <hi>they have ſcattered my people,</hi> and that <hi>among the Nations,</hi> where they could not enjoy publick Ordinances. 11. What the Lord hath impropriate to himſelf for the uſe of his people, it is but folly for men to expect a bleſſed poſſeſſion of it; Therefore doth a challenge, and Gods ſevere pleading follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, <hi>they parted my land.</hi> 12. When the Lords people do ſleight and provoke him, it is juſt he give them up to get baſe and contemptible uſage, and that they and their children be at the diſpoſal of enemies; That ſo they may know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his ſervice, and their imperious dominion: For, ſuch in Gods juſtice was <hi>Judahs</hi> lot, the enemies did <hi>caſt lots</hi> for them, and divided them with the reſt of the ſpoile, to be ſlaves to them; And they gave <hi>boyes</hi> and <hi>girles</hi> to harlots for ſatisfying their luſts, and for drink, that is, either they gave the Boyes and Girles to be ſlaves to their harlots, and ſuch as would furniſh them drink, or they ſold them, and gave the price of them for theſe ends. See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.8. 13. Whatever be Gods juſtice in afflicting his people, yet he will reckon with men for their immoderate uſe of victories, and for their inſolency towards his ſubdued people, their putting them from their priviledges, and uſing them unbeſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly: And eſpecially, he will reckon with them when they only ſerve their luſts with all their purchaſe and conqueſts, as is their uſual way: For, God pleads with them here, that <hi>they have caſt lots for my people,</hi> (made ſlaves of them, and divided them as common prey,) <hi>and have given a boy for an harlot, and ſold a girle for wine, that they might drink.</hi>

Such will finde that God is their party, who will reſent the injuries they do, and will be avenged; For, <hi>what have ye to do with me, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith he, and this he brings with a <hi>yea alſo,</hi> as being eſpecially offended at them for it. 3. God will put enemies to give an account what their
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:114928:174"/>
quarrel hath been, upon which they did trouble his people: and will reckon with them according as they voluntarily, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly imbarqued in that courſe; and will let them know how baſe they are in his account becauſe of it; For, ſaith he, <hi>what have ye to do with me?</hi> or, wherein have I offended you? and ſo ſome underſtand that, <hi>will ye render me a recompence?</hi> will ye requite any injury done by me to you, by afflicting my people? but I have given you no provocation. The firſt words will alſo read, <hi>what are ye to me?</hi> that is, what intereſt can ye pretend to in me, or of what worth are ye to me, that I ſhould paſſe over this great injury? 4. Though enemies do account baſely of Gods people, and think little of the injuries done to them; yet they are ſo precious in Gods eyes, that enemies cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him, nor make reſtitution anſwerable to the damage done by them; for, albeit they think in eaſie to recompence, <hi>(and if ye recompence me,)</hi> yet ſaith he, <hi>will ye render me a recompence?</hi> he ſpeaks of it as a thing impoſſible. 5. As by the Law ſuch as had not wherewith to make reſtitution, did ſuffer in their perſons, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.3. So the Lord by ſad plagues, will let enemies know that no leſſe then their deſtruction can repaire the damage done by them to his people; For, ſaith he, <hi>I will returne your recompence upon your own head,</hi> that is, as a man being offered an unworthy recompence, doth in anger caſt it at them again who preſume to offer it; So the Lord will let them know what the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence muſt be, and will returne upon their own head, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their injuries deſerved. 6. Albeit the Lord ſeem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay long from avenging the injuries done to his people; yet it doth not only certainly come at laſt, but it doth ſurprize ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and after he once beginneth to appear, he will make a ſhort work, and ſo execute judgement as one haſting to be avenged: In this reſpect it is that he ſaith, <hi>ſwiftly and ſpeedily will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne your recom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ence.</hi> 7. It is an horrid injury which God will avenge, when men do ſpoile Gods people of the wealth he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, that ſo they may inrich themſelves by their calamities; or when they dare take away, and intervert that which is devoted to him and his ſervice; for, this is one part of the quarrel, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have taken my ſilver and my told, and my goodly pleaſant things:</hi> whereby we may underſtand both the wealth and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things beſtowed upon his people, which now in avenging the quarrel, he owneth as his; and theſe things that were laid up for his ſervice in the Temple. 8. This ſin is yet more odious, when men not only injuſtly take away what doth not belong to them; but when all
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:114928:175"/>
this purchaſe is conſecrated to advance and cry up a falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For, ſaith he, <hi>ye have carried into your temples my goodly pleaſant things.</hi> Not all which they had injuſtly taken away, but theſe things that were moſt excellent, (and belike, what they got of that which belonged to the Temple,) as an oblation to their Idols. 9. As God hates cruelty, eſpecially againſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and that men ſhould not only ſpoile them of their goods, but bring themſelves into ſlavery and bondage; So it is an iniquity which he will avenge, when men labour to make the condition of his people deſperate, and without hope of reſtitution, that ſo they may poſſeſſe their rights: For, it is another branch of the quarrel, <hi>the children alſo of Judah, and the children of Jeruſalem have ye ſold unto the Grecians,</hi> (with whom the <hi>Tyrians</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, <hi>Ezek</hi> 27.2, 13.) <hi>that ye might remove them far from the border.</hi>

                     <p>In oppoſition unto, and for a recompence of this their cruelty, the Lord paſſeth ſentence in favours of his people, and againſt theſe whom he hath thus pleaded with. Wherein he undertakes to gather his people, and bring them from under that bondage, and to reward theſe enemies, by bringing them under the power of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who ſhall ſell them for ſlaves to the remoteſt <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians,</hi> according as he hath determined. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mens projects be againſt the Church, yet they will never gain their point againſt her; For though they would have had the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſo far removed, as they might never returne; yet ſaith he, <hi>I will raiſe them up.</hi> 2. The Lord can reſtore his people when he pleaſeth, and when his time cometh, neither his former reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, nor their deſperate condition will hinder it; For,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:114928:175"/>
though they ſold them, that they might never returne; yet ſaith he, <hi>I will raiſe them out of the place whither ye have ſold them.</hi> 3.

The wonderfulneſſe of what God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, ſhould be no impediment to our faith, for God both can and will bring about the deliverance of his people in an admirable way; <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will raiſe them.</hi> 5. The triumphing of enemies for a long time, is no ground of aſſurance that they ſhall ſtill eſcape; But God in due time, and at the deliverance of his people, will repay them for all they have done; for, when God doth all this for his people, it is alſo added, <hi>and will returne your recompence upon your own head.</hi> 6. God will repay enemies in the ſame meaſure they have meaſured to his people, and he may make his Church inſtrumental in it; And however the judgement be executed, yet he is ſtill the principal agent in it: For, <hi>I will ſell your ſons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah,</hi> (or, deliver them over into their hand, and put them under their power, to be at their diſpoſal; For, ſo <hi>to ſell</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.14. and frequently,) <hi>and they ſhall ſell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off.</hi> For the <hi>Sabeans</hi> were on the remote coaſts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> or, it may be underſtood that theſe <hi>Sabeans</hi> ſhould ſell them to a people yet more remote: In which ſentence we ought to read the juſtice of God, in dealing with them as they dealt with <hi>Judah.</hi> 7. Gods Word is ſufficient for the Church to reſt upon in expecting greateſt things; And it may be ſufficient ground of terrour to enemies, that the Word hath ſpoken ſad things againſt them; Therefore it is added by way of confirmation, <hi>for the Lord hath ſpoken it.</hi>

                     <p>Followeth the way of executing this ſentence thus pronounced. In recording whereof, firſt, (in theſe Verſes) we have again the convocation of theſe enemies for that effect. It is declared that they ſhall be gathered together by the effectual providence of God to fight againſt his people, <hi>v.</hi> 9. That they ſhall prepare ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour as much as they can, and ſhall encourage one another to war, wherein there ſhall be no vacation, but even the weak ſhall take courage to go on in this enterprize, <hi>v.</hi> 10. And that they ſhould convene not a few, but as many on every hand as might encloſe the people of God; and yet the Lord ſhould have his mighty inſtruments for executing vengeance there alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and ſhould make all this their enterprize but a convocation of them to the place which he hath appointed for judging them, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting vengeance upon them, <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes of enemies are but ſervice of divine providence, and they are but doing that which he ſtirs them up to do for bringing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his holy ends; For, this proclamation to <hi>prepare war, wake up the mighty men, &amp;c.</hi> tends to ſhew, that their enterprizing of this, is of God, to bring about his purpoſes. See <hi>Acts</hi> 4 27, 28. 2. God is not afraid of mens attempts, nor of the courage of the mighty, nor of their vigilancy, activity, numbers or preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:114928:176"/>
nor needs he ſteal a ſtroak upon them, but can let them do their utmoſt, and then work his point thereby, and make their purpoſes void: For, what they will do, he calls upon them to do it, and to uſe all endeavours, that his glory may ſhine in defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.9, 10. 3. Men may have much reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and great undertaking; there may be much courage and eagerneſſe, even among the weakeſt; and they may be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another to work, and laying aſide other employments that they may proſecute this work ſeriouſly, when yet they are but running on their own deſtruction; For, they are <hi>waking up,</hi> or exciting themſelves, they are <hi>coming up</hi> againſt hilly <hi>Judea,, the weak are ſaying, I am ſtrong,</hi> and they are laying aſide husbandry, and <hi>beating their plow-ſhares into ſwords, &amp;c.</hi> when yet God is convening them for judgement. 4. Warre is a ſcourge full of evils, and an enemy to profitable callings and husbandry; For, then they <hi>beat their plow-ſhares into ſwords, and their pruning-hookes into ſpeares,</hi> whereas in peace it is contrary, <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.3. 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the Lords end and purpoſe in convocating enemies, yet the Church may have much exerciſe with it, and may be environ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands with difficulties and dangers thereby, before ſhe get an iſſue, and before his purpoſes do appear; For, <hi>Aſſemble your ſelves, and come all ye heathen, and gather your ſelves together round about,</hi> imports that theſe enemies ſhall firſt incloſe the Church on every hand, before that God appear againſt them. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9. 6. The Lords diſtreſſing of the Church by ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, calls on her to pray, and look to him who only can ſecure her; and as ſhe ſhould not reſt on her being afflicted, as if that were enough to plead pity, when yet ſhe cryeth not to God; So ſhe ſhould not be diffident, nor diſcouraged to call on him, whatever her diſtreſſe be; Therefore is it ſubjoyned to this great diſtreſſe, <hi>Thither cauſe thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord,</hi> pointing out that the Churches refuge will be prayer to him at that time. 7. God hath alſufficiency of power and inſtruments, who will be able to do for his Church when ſhe calls to him, were all the world-againſt her; For, <hi>Thither cauſe thy mighty ones to come down,</hi> is a promiſe that he will provide inſtruments armed with his power, whom he will bring down to the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> at that time, though he will firſt put his Church to it, to intreat him to do this for her, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.37. It is needleſſe to enquire who theſe <hi>mighty ones</hi> are, whether Angels, inflicting ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary judgement, or the enemies themſelves thus convened,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:114928:177"/>
whom he will inable to cut off one another; But it ſeemeth that there will be ſomewhat extraordinary in the overthrow of <hi>Iſraels</hi> enemies, as is his uſual way when his Church is brought into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger. See <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.9. 8. It is an heathen-like mark upon men, to come in oppoſition to the Church of God; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they ſo oft called <hi>the heathen</hi> here. Which though it may be underſtood only of <hi>the Nations;</hi> yet as all theſe were heathens in <hi>Joels</hi> time, ſo be of what profeſſion they will, they prove them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves heathens who would bear down the Church of the true God, and particularly, who would cruſh the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being turned to him after her long rejection. 9. The Lord would have his people infallibly aſſured that he is nothing troubled with the oppoſition of enemies; and albeit they be often ſhaken with the apprehenſions of their formidable power and preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; yet they would recollect themſelves, and ſee Gods over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling hand in all of them; Therefore again ſaith he, <hi>let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of Jehoſhaphat.</hi> And by repeating of it, would have his Church perſwaded that he hath an hand in it, and knoweth how to over-rule it. 10. God will make uſe of enemies gathering themſelves to ſecure them from fleeing his judgement; wherein he will deal with them as delinquents brought before his tribunal, in the place which he hath appointed; Therefore it is again repeated from <hi>v.</hi> 2. that he brings them to <hi>the valley of Jehoſhaphat, for there will I ſit to judge all the heathen round about.</hi>

                     <p>In the next place, the delinquents and executioners being thus convened, the Lord commands his inſtruments (like prepared reapers brought to a field of ripe corne) to do execution upon them, becauſe their ſin is now come to an height, and they are ripe for judgement, as ripe corne is for cutting down, and full fats and wine-preſſes for treading out. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When God ariſeth to judgement, he will not only give out ſentence, but real execution will follow thereupon; So much doth this command, after the former proceſſe, teach. 2. Albeit the leaſt
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:114928:177"/>
ſin deſerveth greateſt plagues, even when it is firſt committed, yet ſuch is Gods patience and long-ſuffering, thae he will not at firſt puniſh even the ſins of enemies, but will let them tipen and come to an height, before he ſmite; Therefore is it that after all this oppoſition of enemies, he now declareth, that <hi>the harveſt is ripe.</hi> See <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.16. 3. Albeit the Lords long-ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience be ſo great, yet the ſin of enemies will at laſt ripen and come to a very great height; For, now ſaith he, <hi>the harveſt is ripe, the preſſe is full, the fats overflow,</hi> to wit, with grapes to be preſſed and trodden out: and this is afterward expreſſed in proper tearmes, <hi>their wickedneſſe is great.</hi> 4. When ſin is ripe, then execution of vengeance will no longer be forborne, but the greatneſſe of ſin will be made viſible in the greatneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Therefore becaoſe of this ripeneſſe and great wickedneſs, the command is given, <hi>put ye in the ſickle,</hi> (to cut down this ripe corne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.15.) <hi>come, get you down, &amp;c.</hi> to wit, into the valley, to tread and preſſe out the grapes.</p>

Whatever be the delights and enjoyments of Gods enemies; yet when he begins to reckon with them, all their comforts and refuges from heaven or earth, will faile them, and all things will frowne and lowre upon them; For, ſo much is imported in that <hi>the Sunne and Moon ſhall be darkened, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe creatures ſhall deny them light and comfort, and this ſhall make all things dark on earth to them, and theſe dreadful ſights ſhall terrifie them.</p>

The firſt promiſe, is, that when the Lord ſhall manifeſt himſelf thus terribly againſt their enemies, according to the predictions of his Word, and out of his love to his people, and when he ſhall make great alterations therby (which is a further amplification of the calamities which are to come on enemies;) Yet in the midſt of theſe confuſions and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, he will afford hope and ſtrength to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When God manifeſts himſelf againſt his Churches enemies, and ſpecially, againſt Iſraels adverſaries, he will be very terrible and dreadful; And his being a party, will make all the creatures to deny comfort, and will adde to the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and terrour of ſuch a deſolate condition; for, <hi>the Lord ſhall roar,</hi> like a Lion, ſee <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.13, 14. And beſide their deſolate condition, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>the Lord alſo ſhall roar,</hi> to imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, and as the cauſe of it, as is after cleared of the ſhaking of heaven and earth. 2. Gods executing of vengeance will be according to the predictions uttered in the Church, and theſe will be found terrible in execution, what ever men thought of them before; for, <hi>the Lord ſhall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jeruſalem</hi> imports, that God from out of <hi>Zion</hi> had ſpoken againſt them by his Word, and that now his ſpeech going forth in execution, ſhall be found terrible, as the roaring of a Lion. 3. God will make his preſence with, and love to his people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous by his indignation and ſeverity againſt their enemies; for, <hi>the Lord ſhall roar out of Zion, &amp;c.</hi> imports alſo that he is preſent there, and that he evidenceth his reſpect to his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by his dreadful thunderings againſt the enemies thereof. 4. As God is powerful to overturne heaven and earth when he pleaſeth; So his ſubduing of enemies may bring great alterations and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings in the world; for, when he ſhall roar, <hi>the heavens and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:114928:179"/>
the earth ſhall ſhake,</hi> which, together with what is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 15. maketh a compleat parallel with the condition of the Church, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.10. and it imports ſuch an alteration of affairs, as if there were a diſſolution of the world, and overturning of the courſe of nature. And it is no wonder, if they who are ſo well rooted in the world, cauſe it to ſhake hefore they be caſt out of it, and if they who are ſo univerſally ſpread through the earth, need gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral commotions to make them miſerable. 5. When God is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the earth to overturne enemies, Gods people, may be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed with many fears and apprehenſions that the ſtorme will break upon them; Therefore they need a promiſe to ſecure them againſt this. 6. Nothing will be able to ſecure the hearts of Gods people againſt the terrours of a time of great commotions, but God only, and what they finde in him and from him; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the promiſe remit them to what <hi>the Lord will be</hi> unto them. 7. In times of great confuſion, the Lords people may expect that he will be a place of refuge to hide them in, that he will furniſh them who come to him, with ground of hope for the future, and with ſtrength and courage to bear out till the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment come: for, that which is propounded here, <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What the Lord hath been or will be at any time to his people Iſrael, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſpiritual promiſes, that he will be to all who are indeed his people; Therefore doth the promiſe run generally both to <hi>his people</hi> whoever they be, and <hi>to the children of Iſrael.</hi>

The third promiſe is that (for fitting them to enjoy his preſence) he will make them holy by ſanctification; And upon this ſhall follow their preſervation
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:114928:179"/>
from the invaſion of open enemies, and that they ſhall not be expoſed as a prey to them, as formerly they had beene. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in Scripture-language is underſtood by their being <hi>holy,</hi> as it is obſerved in <hi>Obad. v.</hi> 17. partly becauſe of the ceremonial pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that of old did accompany the invaſion of their land by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, beſide that it did obſcure their priviledge of being the Lords peculiar, ſanctified, and ſet apart people; But chiefly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as is uſual in wars, when prophane Nations invade the Cuhrch) they did overturne holy ordinances, and caſt all looſe and in confuſion. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Intereſt in God is the great ground of the Churches encouragement; for, it is held out as their great mercie, <hi>I am the Lord your God.</hi> 2. This intereſt is yet more ſweet when it is evidenced by his preſence and the gracious effects thereof among his people, and he is not provoked to forſake them, though they be his; Therefore it is added, <hi>I am the Lord your God dwelling in Zion.</hi> 3. It is an addition to all theſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, when not only matters ſtand ſo, but the Church knoweth it, and is convinced of it; And this muſt be Gods own work, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whoſe help, they will neither ſee intereſt nor preſence, who yet in reality enjoy both; Therefore he undertakes it, to make their comfort and mercy compleat, <hi>Ye ſhall know that I am the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. 4. The Lord will in due time make his intereſt in, and preſence with his people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly clear, by viſible diſpenſations and actings for them; for, <hi>ſo</hi> (by what I will do for you) <hi>ſhall ye know that I am the Lord your God, &amp;c.</hi> 5. Where God takes up his dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, all that concernes them becometh his, and he takes care thereof; for, then it is <hi>my mountaine,</hi> to wit, <hi>Zion</hi> where he dwelleth. 6. Gods preſence with a people muſt be entertained and proven by their holineſſe; for, then it is <hi>my holy mountaine,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is <hi>holy.</hi> See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93.5. 7. It is God only who can undertake for making his people holy, and it is their duty to deny themſelves, and imploy him for that end; for, it is his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>then ſhall Jeruſalem be holy.</hi> 8. Where a people have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſanctification, as a fruit and evidence of Gods preſence, they have alſo the promiſe that he will preſerve them from the invaſion of enemies; for, <hi>then ſhall Jeruſalem be holy</hi> in this reſpect alſo, that <hi>no ſtranger ſhall paſſe thorow her,</hi> to wit, in an hoſtile way. And albeit this ſeeme to be a peculiar promiſe to convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Iſrael, and albeit others (even <hi>Judah</hi> it ſelf) when they have been upon the amending hand, have met with ſad ſtormes from enemies; Yet certainly ſuch have the promiſe of this mercy, when

it is for their good; and what they meet with which ſeemeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it, is but to ſtir them up yet more to the ſtudy of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in that reſpect they get a bleſſed iſſue from their troubles, and will come to a compleat iſſue at laſt. 9. It is a ſad ingredient in the trouble of the Lords people, when they are invaded by profane Nations, that not only their priviledges are obſcured thereby, but that their invaſion and the confuſions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned therreby, together with their corrupt principles and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, do caſt l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

To this is ſubjoyned the fifth promiſe, that this plenty
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:114928:180"/>
ſhould be accompanied with ſpiritual graces and refreſhments, conveighed by the Goſpel, and flowing forth not only for their own quickening and comfort, but for the good of the Nations round about, even of thoſe whoſe condition ſeemeth moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. To clear this promiſe a little, we have firſt, 1. The benefit it ſelf, compared to a fountain of waters flowing out, whereby (as is cleared on <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.8.) is underſtood all ſpiritual graces and refreſhments, which are held forth, and inſtrumentally communicated and conveighed to ſinners by the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and applied and quickened by the Spirit. 2. We have the fountaine and riſe of this benefit, it <hi>ſhall come forth of the houſe of the Lord.</hi> It is conceived that the ſpeech alludeth to ſome conduits that conveighed water to the Temple, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came by the Altar to waſh away the blood that was poured out there, and ſo ran out again with it. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.1. and ſo it ſhould point out, that as theſe waters flowed out from the Temple with the blood of the ſacrifices; So theſe Goſpel-refreſhments and graces do flow out unto the world from the death of Chriſt. Which is a truth of it ſelf, that Chriſt is to be acknowledged for all of theſe, whatever be ſaid of the alluſion. Or it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thus, that as of old the Doctrine of the Goſpel conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe graces and refreſhments, came from <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Iſa.</hi> 2.3. ſo after the converſion of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming <hi>the houſe of the Lord,</hi> theſe ſame refreſhing waters ſhould flow out again from them. And this leads to the third thing to be explained, which is the extent of this benefit, that it ſhall flow out as a river to water not only <hi>Judea,</hi> but the country about, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that there ſhould not only be abundance of ſaving doctrine, and of graces and refreſhments in the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but that fountaine opened up among them ſhould flow forth to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to water them and make them fruitful. And in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>the valley of Shittim</hi> is named; which is a plaine in <hi>Moah, Numb.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 2.1. which it ſeemes was barren, and the waters thereof unwholeſome, by reaſon it lay ſo near the Dead-ſea, or lake of <hi>Sodome;</hi> And yet it is promiſed that this fountain ſhall water it, and make it fruitful. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.8. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Piety hath indeed the promiſes, and is the ſhorteſt cut to do well every way; and where the Lord cometh, and is entertained in ſpiritual benefits, he will give what is good in other things; for, converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall get an ample proof of what God is able to do in all ages, if it were for his peoples good, <hi>In that day
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:114928:181"/>
the mountaines ſhall drop down new wine, and the hills ſhall flow with milke, and all the rivers of Judah ſhall flow with waters.</hi> 2. It is the great fault even of the Lords people, that their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of mercies decayeth, becauſe they are common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; whereas Gods hand ſhould be ſeen diſpenſing them in a peculiar way to them: And to prevent their miſcarriage, he doth ſo order their outward mercies, as his ſpecial providence may be ſeen in giving them. Therefore doth he make promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe temporal things, that they may ſee more then others in his giving thereof to them. And he did ſo order matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their land, as the having abundance of water, (which is a very common benefit among many others) ſhould be a ſpecial favour to them. 3. When the Lord lets out much plenty to his Church, there is great need of much of the grace of God, and ſpiritual things of his Kingdome therewith, to ſeaſon and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the uſe thereof unto her. Therefore is there a ſpiritual promiſe ſubjoyned to the former; albeit it was ſaid before, they ſhould be holy. Without this, proſperity is but a ſnare, and it is an evidence of an ill condition, when much plenty doth not put men to it, to preſſe after the enjoyment of God, and after grace ſo much the more. 4. As the graces and bleſſings held out and conveighed by the Goſpel, are the great refreſhment of the children of men, (and therefore compared to a <hi>fountain</hi> of waters, which quencheth thirſt, and refreſheth and watereth the earth;) So where they are once received, they will never utterly decay, and will ſtill be refreſhful and comfortable; Therefore are they compared to <hi>a fountain coming forth,</hi> or a ſpring which never runs dry, and the waters thereof are ſtill freſh. 5. Spiritual Goſpel-bleſſings are twice mercies, when not only they refreſh and do good to theſe who receive them; but do make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to make the ſame ſpread to others; for, it is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of this fountain that it <hi>ſhall come forth;</hi> not only to water themſelves, but others. 6. As at the firſt the riches of the Goſpel flowed out from among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and by the Miniſtery of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> So again converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be made inſtrumental to propagate the Goſpel and the Kingdom of Chriſt to other Nations; For, then a fountain ſhall come <hi>forth of the houſe of the Lord, and ſhall water the valley of Shittim.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. 7. The Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the graces and refreſhments communicated thereby, are able to cure and recover them whoſe condition is moſt deadly, and to make them fruitful
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:114928:181"/>
who have been moſt barren: And in particular, converted <hi>Iſrael</hi> will be employed to bring in Nations to Chriſt, who have layen ſtill under the curſe, during the rime of the Goſpels ſpreading among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> though poſſibly at the firſt going forth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many of them have heard ſomewhat of it: So much ſeemeth to be ſignified by this fountaines watering even <hi>the valley of Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim,</hi> though it be probable that even then ſome will be left ſtill in their former condition. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47.8.</p>

This is oft repeated again and again, that others who trace theſe ſteps, may ſee their own danger before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, and ſtudy to prevent it; and to aſſure the godly that this is not a raſh ſentence, but ſuch as he will not recal it. 2. A peoples oppoſition to the Church of God, and their violence and cruelty toward them, is a ſpecial controverſie which God will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute; for, this ſentence is given out, <hi>for the violence againſt the children of Judah, becauſe they have ſhed blood, &amp;c.</hi> 3. The Lords controverſie againſt his people for ſin, becauſe of which he lets enemies looſe upon them, doth not make the quarrel of enemies the more juſt, nor doth his peoples blood which they ſhed, ceaſe to be innocent blood for all that, and to cry for venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon them; For, ſaith he, <hi>they have ſhed innocent blood.</hi>
                        <pb n="346" facs="tcp:114928:182"/>
4. If this, that they have ſhed blood <hi>in their land,</hi> be referred to <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> that they were cruell to ſuch <hi>Jewes</hi> as lived in exile among them; It doth teach, that mens cruelty is ſo much the more odious before God, when it is exerciſed on theſe who are already broken with afflictions. But it ſeemes rather to be underſtood of the <hi>Jewes</hi> land, which theſe enemies invaded: and ſo it holds out that cruelty is odious when men exerciſe it upon theſe who have given them no provocation, as they did on <hi>Judah,</hi> when they were ſtaying at home, and not troubling them. 5. Albeit the Church do oftentimes ſeem to be furtheſt behinde of any ſociety, for outward proſperity; yet the time will come, when ſhe ſhall ſee her own mercy in the miſery of others, and ſhall be in good condition when they are gone; for, in oppoſition to what ſhall come on <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> it is added, <hi>But Judah ſhall dwell for ever, &amp;c.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.30, 31. 6.

                     <p>All theſe promiſes, (and particularly that of perpetuating the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>) are confirmed by a new promiſe, wherein the Lord undertakes to purge her by Juſtification and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, from the pollution wherein ſhe had layen ſo long; and that he will do this, becauſe he dwells, (or, that ſo he may dwell) among them by his Word and Spirit, with no leſſe bleſſing then of old. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Sin when it is rightly looked upon, will be found a very vile and loathſome thing, and they will ſo judge of it whom God is about to deliver from it; Therefore is not only the bloody crimes, but all the iniquity of theſe whom he is about to purge, called <hi>their blood,</hi> as, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. 2. There can be no aſſurance of obtaining other favour, till this pollution be done away; Therefore this promiſe cometh in as a confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the former, and making way for them, <hi>For I will clenſe their blood.</hi> 3. There can be no purging of ſin to fit us for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mercies, till God interpoſe in it, and till he apply the merit and efficacy of the death of Chriſt to take away the guilt and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution

thereof; and this he will do to his own, he will ſend this mercy, to fit and prepare them for moe, <hi>I will clenſe their blood,</hi> ſaith he. The endeavours of ſuch as are moſt convinced of ſin, will not availe without this, and till they imploy him for this end. 4. The Lords former rejecting of a people, and giving them up to walk in their own wayes, will not hinder his reſpecting them and purging their ſin in a time of love: For, albeit <hi>Iſrael</hi> have now for many ages not been clenſed, yet ſaith he, <hi>I will clenſe their blood that I have not clenſed.</hi> 5. As it is the Lords preſence in favour with a people, and not their merit, that aſſures them of his purging their ſin, (for, this is done, <hi>for the Lord dwelleth in Zion?</hi>) So his clenſing of a people from ſin, doth aſſure them more and more that he will abide with them; for, ſo will the words alſo read, <hi>I will clenſe, &amp;c. and the Lord,</hi> or <hi>ſo ſhall the Lord dwell in Zion.</hi>

                     <p>The inſcription of this Prophecy, holds forth firſt, That <hi>Amos</hi> who carried this meſſage, was but a meane man of <hi>Tekoa</hi> in <hi>Judah,</hi> (of which 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 11, 5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.1.) and of a mean employment, being but an Herdman and of the meaneſt ſort; not one who had herds which were kept and fed by others, (as the word here uſed ſomtime ſignifieth, 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 3, 4.) but one who was either a mean ſervant to others, or at beſt, a mean man who fed his own cattel, as appeareth from <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.15. Secondly it holds forth that he was ſent eſpecially to <hi>Jſrael,</hi> though he deale alſo with others upon occaſion. And thirdly that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Divine meſſage, and began his preaching in the days of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> and <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond, two years before that earthquake of which mention is made onely here and <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.5. Some conceive it to have been in the year of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziahs</hi> death, and that it is hinted at <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.1, 4: Others, that it was at the time of his preſuming to offer incenſe, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.16. as another teſtimony (beſide his leproſie, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.20.) of divine diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his courſe; But at whatever time it was, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that hereby the Lord gave warning of great and dreadful commotions and alterations that were to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Nations, as accordingly came to paſſe on <hi>Iſrael</hi> after the death of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The word of the Lord ought not to be rejected in the mouth of meaneſt inſtruments; nor is their authority to be ſuſpected or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned becauſe they are meane; for <hi>Amos who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, hath the words which he ſaw concerning Iſrael.</hi> 2. Albeit that men ought not to uſurp the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial calling, nor leave their mechanick and ſervile em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, to intrude themſelves upon it, (for, <hi>Amos</hi> had an extraordinary calling) and albeit men who are called to that office, ought not to tempt God, by neglecting law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means appointed for their enabling to diſcharge their calling, (for, the endowments of <hi>Amos,</hi> who was, not bred for that calling, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14 were by extraordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation) Yet ſuch as are called of God, and are conſcious to themſelves of much inſufficency and inability, though
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:114928:184"/>
they uſe means; ſuch I ſay have notable encouragment to come to God for teaching and furniture in an ordinary way, who hath given ſuch proofe of his fulneſſe in raiſing up and inſtructing this herdman to be his extraordinary Ambaſſadour. 3. Such as give but ill entertainment to the meſſages they receive, may get rougher meſſages ſent unto them; and ſuch as deſpiſe eminent and diſcreet meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, God may ſend ſuch to them as will uſe them more roughly; for <hi>Iſrael</hi> had many notable Prophets both before and at this time, who being deſpiſed, he employes this <hi>herdman,</hi> who was not onely hatefull to them, as being a <hi>Jew</hi> and a baſe man, and ſo it might lay their pride when God ſent ſuch a one unto them; but God makes uſe of his ruſtick and rude humour, that they might be dealt with plainly and roughly, who now through their own obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy were become like the brute beaſts which <hi>Amos</hi> had kept before. 4. Such as are called of God, were they never ſo mean, may boldly and on all hazards declare his minde to a ſinfull people; and their courage is a teſtimony of their calling, witneſſing againſt all deſpiſers; for as <hi>Amos</hi> durſt deale freely with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and tell <hi>the words which he ſaw concerning Iſrael;</hi> ſo the Lord did convince <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he was called by him, in that he durſt leave his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and truſting in God, durſt deale freely with this flouriſhing Kingdom, according to their deſervings. 5. It is a great ſnare to a wicked Nation, when they proſper notwithſtanding their wickedneſſe; and there is need in ſuch a caſe, that the wrath of God purſuing ſin be frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inculcate from the word, <hi>that men may not deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; therefore is Amos</hi> (as well as <hi>Hoſea</hi>) ſent with theſe hard tidings; in the days of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> and in the days of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> &amp;c. Both of which had proſperous reignes, at leaſt for a time, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 14, 23, 24, 25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. <hi>Chron,</hi> 26. 3, 6, 7. 6. When the Word of the Lord is not regarded, it is juſt with him to preach to a people by his judgements, and by unnatural and extraordinary ſignes and wonders, to let them know his anger; ſo much may be gathered from this Earthquake which was a terrible ſtroak and warning to that people who beleived not, and therefore is taken ſpecial notice of here, and long after. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.5.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>This verſe holds out the ſumme of the whole Prophecy, to wit, that God was about to manifeſt his terror in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions according to the threatnings of his Word. As the ſentence may relate to heathen Nations round about, who are alſo threatned by this Prophet, it hath been ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon <hi>Ioel,</hi> 3.16. But as it relates to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom this Prophet is chiefly ſent, and to whom the moſt part of what followeth is directed, the ſenſe and ſumme of it is; that the Prophet ſpeaking in his own termes, (who was well acquainted with the roaring of Lions in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and with paſtures for ſheep) declares, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſince their defection from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> deſpiſed the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> yet they ſhould finde that God dwelt there, and that the true Doctrine ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there, and from thence; and as other Prophets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and he among the reſt, were ſent out by God dwelling in <hi>Zion</hi> (and ſome of them from thence) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his terrible judgements; ſo theſe threatnings were now to break forth in dreadful execution. In ſomuch that the <hi>habitations of the ſhepherds ſhall mourn</hi> &amp;c. Whereby we may underſtand, that all their fertile and pleaſant places (ſuch as their green paſtures, and fruitfull Carmel, either that in Aſher near the Sea, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.24, 26. <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.18. or rather that in <hi>Judah</hi> better known to him, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 15.21, 55. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.2.) ſhould be laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate; and that as the Land ſhould feele the ſtroak, ſo the inhabitants being deprived of their delighted-in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, ſhould be filled with ſorrow and griefe, and be made to mourn, as herdmen do when their paſtures are dried up. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. However the Church and truth of God be contemned by theſe who make defection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and God may ſeem to lie by for a time from aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this; Yet he will appear to aſſert his preſence in his Church, and to manifeſt the truth of his word by execution according to it: for <hi>the Lord will roare from Zion</hi> (his dwelling place) <hi>and utter his voice from Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Temple ſtood; that is, he will now in a terrible way,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:114928:185"/>
make it manifeſt, that what Doctrine was preached there, and elſewhere in his name, was his word. 2. However men contemn God in the matter of ſubjection to him; yet he will be their party to puniſh them for their ſin whether they will or no; for <hi>Amos</hi> gets it in Commiſſion to publiſh, that God will manifeſt himſelf dreadful againſt them, and he ſaid, <hi>the Lord will roar from Zion</hi> &amp;c. 3. The Lords word, how much ſoever it be deſpiſed, yet it will prove terrible to the ſtouteſt, when it breaks fourth in execution; for <hi>the Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jeruſalem,</hi> that is, his threatnings, though deſpiſed, will prove thus dreadful in that day. 4. God is provoked to make the creaturres whereof man makes uſe, feel his anger and ſmart under it, if men will not be ſenſible; for the <hi>habitations of the ſhepherds ſhall mourn, and the top of Carmel ſhall wither,</hi> that is, their pleaſant paſtures, and the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of their friutful Fields (as Carmel ſignifieth) ſhall feele the ſtroak. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 12.11. 5. Whatever fruitful or pleaſant thing it be that men lean to, and delight in, neglecting God, it will certainly in due time decay till no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be left them but ſorrow for the want of them; for ſo much alſo is imported here, in that <hi>the habitations of ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſhall mourn;</hi> not onely ſhall the Land be put in a mournful poſture, but the inhabitants ſhall be filled with ſorrow.</p>

                     <p>Albeit the Lord ſends <hi>Amos</hi> chiefly to preach againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (as appears from <hi>v.</hi> 1.) yet he ordains him to begin with accuſations and threatnings againſt forraign Nations round about, before he come to deal with them. And accordingly in this and the beginning of the next Chapter, there are ſix of theſe Nations ſpoken to. We may conceive theſe reaſons why the Lord followeth this method. 1. That however this Prophet was a mean man, yet <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be convinced of his Authority and Commiſſion to be a Prophet, in that God had revealed his mind to him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:114928:186"/>
ſo many Nations beſide themſelves. 2. That when <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould look on other Nations, and ſee them plagued as well as themſelves, they might not (as men are natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unwilling to ſee God in calamities) aſcribe their owne afflictions to fortune or chance among the reſt, ſince others of whom God took no ſuch ſtrict notice, were afflicted as well as they. By theſe predictions God would let them ſee that he had a hand in all of them. 3. This doctrine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Nations tendeth to the aggravation of <hi>Iſraels</hi> guilt, for whoſe ſake God had plagued ſo many (as will appear in the reſt of the Chapter) and yet they proved as bad as any. 4. It tendeth alſo to ſhew unto them, that the preſent proſperity of the wicked Nations ſhould not embolden them to deſpiſe Gods threatnings againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing that proſperity was to come to ſuch an end. 5. From theſe threatnings <hi>Iſrael</hi> might gather that God who puniſhed the Nations who were without the written Law, would not ſpare them who were his people, and knew his will, and who were guilty of ſins, and theſe as groſſe and many as any of the Nations: For they were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters as well as they, and were cruel oppreſſours of their brethren, as well as the heathen whom God was to puniſh for the ſame fault.</p>
                     <p>The firſt Nation here ſpoken to, is <hi>Syria,</hi> whoſe head. City is <hi>Damaſcus, Iſa.</hi> 7.8. Theſe the Lord challengeth, and threatneth not to withhold any longer their deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; And that becauſe of their many and multiplied ſins: and eſpecially becauſe of their cruelty againſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in <hi>Gilead,</hi> which the Hiſtory declareth was done by <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zael,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. <hi>and</hi> 10.32, 33. <hi>And by Benhadad</hi> his ſon, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 13.3, 7. As for this kinde of cruelty of <hi>threſhing</hi> people <hi>with inſtruments of Iron,</hi> it ſeemeth to be the ſame with that 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.31. or ſomewhat like it. It was a kinde of torture inflicted upon vanquiſhed people, which the <hi>Syrians</hi> put in practiſe, or at leaſt did uſe them as cruelly as if they had done ſo. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. God is ſoveraigne Judge of all the world, to give out ſentence according to mens ways, and to ride circuit in it, to ſee his ſentence executed; for ſo much is held forth in this proceſſe led againſt the Nations on every hand, to every one of which, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord;</hi> is prefixed. 2. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent perſons, and ſuch as live in eminent places of a Land,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:114928:186"/>
do ordinarily prove the fountains an promoters of all that evil which draweth down wrath upon the whole Land; for this cauſe it is that here onely <hi>Damaſcus</hi> the chief City is at firſt named; as being (together with the Royall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, comprehended under it, <hi>v.</hi> 4.) the riſe and cauſe of all this provocation and woe. 3. Albeit the Lord be long-ſuffering towards all, yea even towards heathens; yet when men abuſe his patience, by continiance in ſin till there be no end nor remedy, he will ſurely reckon with them, for now it cometh to this, <hi>I will not turn away the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof,</hi> as in <hi>his long-ſuffering</hi> he had done formerly, or he will not let them be quiet, or at peace, or not take pains to convert them any more, but will give them up to reap as they deſerve. 4. The <hi>Lord will then begin to reckon</hi> with a people for ſin, When 1. Their provocations are groſſe for kinde, being tranſgreſſions, or rebellions. 2. When theſe ſins are not few, out multiplied and many, three and four. 3. When their ſins are ſtill growing, and ſin added to ſin, as when it goeth from three to four. 4. When the longer they grow in ſin, their ſins are ſtill the groſſer and more horrid (as it will ſtill be) ſuch as the particular ſin here laid to their charge is. 5. When iniquity continued in, filleth up the compleat meaſure preſcribed by God in his long-ſuffering; for three and four make up ſeven which is a number of perfection. All this is imported in this general chalenge and threatning, which is made uſe of here and afterward, <hi>for three tranſgreſſions and for four, I will not turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the puniſhment, becauſe they have</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Albeit a people may have many ſins and theſe very groſſe, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God againſt themſelves; Yet when God is about to puniſh, there is ordinarily ſome particular ill that puts the capſtone on all the reſt, and fills up the meaſure, and which draws out the ſtroak; Therefore after theſe <hi>three tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and four,</hi> there is here one particular ſin conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended on, as a notable one above the reſt, for which eſpecially God will ſtrike. 6. Cruelty againſt Gods people, as it is a fruit of mens ripeneſſe and comming to an hight in ſin; ſo it is a particular ſin which God will not paſſe over, though he wink at many other faults; for this is the particular ſin here, <hi>becauſe they have threſhed Gilead with threſhing inſtruments of Iron,</hi> the ſub-joining whereof to the generall chalenge, ſheweth that none but they who had
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:114928:187"/>
                        <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> would have followed ſuch a cruel courſe againſt the Church; And that however he had turned away their puniſhment, notwithſtanding many former provocations, yet now becauſe of this he would not ſpare. 7. Before the Lords people ſhall want a ſcourge when they provoke him, he will raiſe up even ſubdued Nations to do that worke; for theſe <hi>Syrians</hi> were ſubdued by <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.15.19. but they began to lift up their head again, upon <hi>Solomons</hi> defection from God, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 11.23, 24, 25: and are now a ſtrong and ſharp ſcourge to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>

                     <p>In theſe verſes is held forth, the particular ſentence and threatning for this ſin; that he will deſtroy the Palaces of their Kings, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and will break the ſtrength of their fortified Cities, and ſo give them up into the enemies hands, who ſhall deſtroy the inhabitants, waſte the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, root out their Kingly race, and ſend the body of the people into captivity, <hi>v.</hi> 5. As for the place here named, <hi>Damaſcus, the plain of Aven,</hi> and <hi>the houſe of Eden,</hi> or <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> it is thus conceived, that as <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was their chief City, and commanded a tract or Province of <hi>Syria</hi> about it; ſo <hi>Aven</hi> was another great City, and chief in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Province (though <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was chief of all) which together with the plain about it, are here threatned, or the name of it was <hi>Bikath-Aven</hi> (which is tranſlated <hi>the plain of Aven</hi>) and it is threatned with the loſſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants: And <hi>the houſe of Eden</hi> or <hi>Beth-Eden,</hi> ſignifying <hi>a place of pleaſure,</hi> was the chief City in another pleaſant Province, called afterward <hi>Coelo-Syria,</hi> from whence their Royall Race came, or they did much reſide there, becauſe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:114928:187"/>
of the pleaſantneſſe of the place, or on other occaſions not left on record, and therefore it is threatned they ſhall be cut off with this place. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods threatnings not to ſpare a wicked people, are not empty words, but will end in reall executions; for ſo doth he expound his general ſentence in the former <hi>v. I will not turn away the puniſhment thereof, but I will ſend a fire</hi> &amp;c. 2. The juſt judgements of God inflicted upon impenitent ſinners, are terrible, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible, and with which no compoſition can be made; therefore are his judgements compared to <hi>a fire</hi> ſent by him, <hi>devouring</hi> all where it cometh. It may be true indeed that theſe Palaces were devoured by fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the reſt likewiſe which are ſo threatned; but it is moſt ſafe to hold in the generall, that his judgments be what they will, will vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently conſume like fire, being inflicted in the fire of his wrath and diſpleaſure. 3. Not onely mean men, but even Kings may expect to ſmart under Gods hand when they provoke him, and that not onely in the ſufferings of their ſubjects, but in the ruine of their own Palaces; for <hi>I will ſend a fire into the houſe of Hazael</hi> (who was one of their Kings, and a cruel enemy to <hi>Iſrael) which ſhall devour the Palaces of Benhadad,</hi> that is, which belonged to <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who was <hi>Hazaels</hi> predeceſſour and Maſter, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 8.7, 15. or to <hi>Benhadad</hi> the Son of <hi>Hazael,</hi> 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 13. 3. The meaning is, that this fire ſhould devour theſe Houſes and Palaces (for they are the ſame thing) though they had been poſſeſſed by never ſo many Kings for a long time. 4. The ſtrength of Cities, or any oppoſition and defence the inhabitants can make, will ſerve in no ſtead when God in anger is a party; for <hi>I will break alſo the bar of Damaſcus,</hi> or that which may ſeem to make it impregnable. 5. Variety of Regions and Provinces united together, and multiplicity of inhabitants therein, will ſerve for nothing when God is angry, but to make the ſtroak of vengeance more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, in overthrowing and cutting off; for all theſe three Provinces and their chief Cities are threatned by him who can eaſily reach them all; and particularly that he will <hi>cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven,</hi> or <hi>Bikath-Aven,</hi> and ſo the place becomes vanity, and reaps the fruit of iniquity, according to the ſignification of the name. 6. Places that are very pleaſant, and Royall Families and Races ought to expect no more exemption then others
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:114928:188"/>
from the ſtroak of an angry God, when they provoke him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſaith he, <hi>I will cut off him that holdeth the Scepter from the houſe of Eden.</hi> 7. Meane perſons will not eſcape deſerved vengeance either, though their provocation be inferiour to that of Rulers; and God is provoked, utterly to unpeople and tranſplant a Nation, when they ſin againſt him, and eſpecially when they invade Gods people in their Land, and exerciſe cruelty upon them; for <hi>the people of Syria ſhall go into captivity, unto Kir, ſaith the Lord;</hi> not that <hi>Kir</hi> in <hi>Moah, Iſa.</hi> 15.1. but another in <hi>Aſſyria</hi> or <hi>Media,</hi> whither the Aſſyrian carries them, as is recorded in the hiſtory, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.9.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond Nation ſpoken of are the Philiſtins. <hi>Gaza</hi> is onely named in the challenge and general ſentence, it may be, becauſe it was chiefe of them at that time, or chiefe in this ſin. In the particular ſentence three other of their Cities are mentioned; onely <hi>Gath,</hi> the fifth City is omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here as in other paſſages of the Prophets, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was in the poſſeſſion of the Jewes, or becauſe it was become more obſcure and ruinous, and ſo is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under the reſt, or for ſome other cauſe not record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſumme of this purpoſe, is, God threatens that he will, not ſpare them becauſe of their manifold provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and particularly, becauſe of their cruelty towards the Jewes, in ſelling all the captives of them they could
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:114928:188"/>
catch, unto <hi>Edom,</hi> who hated them moſt, that ſo they might never returne to their homes, <hi>verſe</hi> 6. And becauſe of this, he gives out a particular ſentence, that he will conſume and deſtroy their chiefe Cities, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Princes or Rulers thereof, and will alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the reſt of that Nation who inhabit the Country and Villages, <hi>verſe</hi> 7, 8. As for this ſinne of the Philiſtins, it ſeemes to relate to the time when Edom revolted from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and returned to exerciſe and let out their wonted ſpight againſt their brethren, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.8, 9, 10. At which time alſo the Philiſtins with others invaded Judah, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 21.16, 17. and whomſoever they took captive, (or any of the Jewes or Iſraelites who fled for ſhelter among them about theſe times, as they did to other places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.4. they delivered them to Edom. The ſtroke here threatned was inflicted on them; partly by <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6. partly by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.8. according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.29. by the Aſſyrians, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 20.1. and finally by the Babylonians (beſide what was done by the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians) <hi>Jer.</hi> 25.20. with <hi>chap.</hi> 47.1, 2, 4. And however ſeverall ſtrokes be threatned to come on ſeverall places here, yet it is not needfull ſo to diſtinguiſh them, as if no more came on any place then is here threatned againſt them in particular; but it may be conceived that all theſe ſtrokes came on every one of them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is the common diſeaſe of the <hi>World, that in all places of it ſin</hi> will be found groſſe and growing, and ripe for vengeance; for here are <hi>three trangreſſions and foure,</hi> as well as in <hi>Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> and ſo alſo in other places, which are afterward threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. 2. God is uniforme in his proceeding, and ſtill the ſame for juſtice and power <hi>to take</hi> a courſe with growing ſinne, in one place as well as in another, were they never ſo many; for <hi>Gaza</hi> and other Nations that are ſpoken of afterward, get the ſame meaſure with <hi>Damaſcus: Thus ſaith the Lord, for three tranſgreſſions and for foure I will not turne away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> 3. Such as are come to an height of impiety and wickedneſſe, are readily given up to employ their power againſt Gods people, that ſo their meaſure may run over, and the ſtroke may be haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out; for ſo <hi>Gaza,</hi> which hath <hi>three tranſgreſſions and foure,</hi> is given up to wrong Judah, upon which, ſpecially, the ſentence is given out. 4. Falſe brethren are greateſt
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:114928:189"/>
enemies, and doe give harder meaſure then any other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the people of God when they come into their hands; for <hi>Edom</hi> was ſo cruel an enemy, that it is greater cruelty in the Philiſtins to deliver the Jewes to them, then if they had kept them in bondage themſelves after they had captivated them. 5. It is great cruelty, and that which God will not look over, when men doe adde affliction to his afflicted People, and are acceſſary in any meaſure to their ill uſage from others, and do what they can to make their caſe deſperate; for it is Gods controverſie with the Philiſtins, <hi>becauſe they carried away captive the whole captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> (or ſo many as they could catch) <hi>to deliver them up to Edom.</hi> When they had afflicted them by taking them captive, they do adde to it; and albeit <hi>Edom</hi> uſe them moſt cruelly, yet they are acceſſory to it, by delivering them up. 6. The enemies of the people of God will gain nothing by their oppreſſion, when God begins to reckon with them, but will aſſuredly draw vengeance upon themſelves; for becauſe of this, <hi>I will ſend a fire</hi> &amp;c. ſaith the Lord. 7. Strong walls and flouriſhing Cities and pleaſant Palaces, multitude of inhabitants, and the power and authority of Rulers, will not ſecure ſinners againſt vengeance, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw forth a more ample proofe of Gods power and juſtice; for <hi>I will ſent a fire on the wall of Gaza, which ſhall devour the Palaces thereof. And I will cut off the inhabitant from Aſhdod, and him that holdeth the Scepter</hi> (or their Lord, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.18.) from <hi>Aſhkelon.</hi> 8. The Lords former ſpare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and permitting of a people to flouriſh, will not ſecure them when ſin is come to an hight; for <hi>I will turn my hand againſt Ekron,</hi> or alter my former indulgence towards it, and now ſmite it. 9. Whatever be the Lords compaſſion and relenting towards his own people, when he is ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; yet he will purſue a controverſie againſt impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and cruel enemies to his Church, ſo long as there is any remnant of them; for, <hi>and the remnant of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines ſhall periſh,</hi> 10. Gods word, who is abſolute and alſufficent, is enough to aſſure men that greateſt and moſt incredible things will come to paſſe; therefore is it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, by way of confirmation to all this, <hi>ſaith the Lord God.</hi>

                     <p>The third people here ſpoken againſt, are the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> whom he chalengeth for their many ſins, and particularly, for the ſame ſin of cruelty againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> whereof the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> were guilty; whereby they manifeſted their prefidious ingratitude in forgetting that Covenant of friendſhip that was betwixt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Tyrus</hi> in the days of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> by reaſon of which they called each other <hi>brethren,</hi> ſee 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5, 11. 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 5.1. and 9.13. Or it may be thus underſtood alſo, that beſide their own ingratitude in dealing ſo cruelly with <hi>Judah,</hi> they forgot alſo the obligation that was lying upon the poſterity of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to deale more kindly with the poſterity of <hi>Jaoob</hi> their brethren; and they ſhould not have ſed or aſſiſted their cruelty againſt their brethren. For this ſin the Lord threatens not to ſpare them any longer, but that he will deſtroy their Town and Palaces. As for the time when <hi>Tyrus</hi> committed this ſin, it ſhould ſeem they ſerved and a aſſiſted <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Benhadad</hi> in their wars againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and it may be, other enemies, or <hi>Iſrael</hi> it ſelf in their enterprizes againſt <hi>Judah;</hi> and what ſhare of captives fell to them, they delivered up to <hi>Edom:</hi> for which they were recompenced according to this threatning by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar, Ezek.</hi> 26.7. &amp;c. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When a Nation doth flouriſh and become potent, it is no wonder to ſee ſin grow and ripen faſt among them, and divine patience towards them come to a period; for, <hi>Tyrus</hi> that flouriſhing City, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. hath <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> for which God <hi>will not turn away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> 2. Prevailing cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies againſt the people of God will not want many agents and aſſiſtants, and the Church in her diſtreſſe may expect to have many foes, to take advantage of her, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe her; for, both the <hi>Philiſtines, v.</hi> 6. and <hi>Tyrus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:114928:190"/>
with <hi>Edom</hi> in their cruelty after their ſucceſsful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, <hi>Tyrus</hi> alſo <hi>delivered vp the whole captivity to Edom.</hi> 3. No friendſhip nor former obligation will bind wicked Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Church in her diſtreſſe, nor will God ſuffer any of theſe relations to avail her, when ſhe provokes him; for <hi>Tyrus</hi> did all this notwithſtanding the <hi>brotherly Covenant.</hi> 4. When God reckons with cruel enemies, he will not forget their obligations to do otherwiſe, that it may ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate their guilt; for, now in the day of account, it is laid to their charge that they did this, <hi>and remembered not the brotherly Covenant.</hi> 5. It is a great iniquity in men to contribute, or be aſſiſtant to others in their unnatural cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt Gods people, eſpecially being bound themſelves to befriend them; for, ſo much alſo may be imported here, that <hi>Tyrus</hi> not onely ſinned in forgeting their own obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in aſſiſting <hi>Edom,</hi> not conſidering what ſtrict ties were upon him to be more kindely to <hi>Iſrael</hi> his brother. 6. The ſtrength of a place either by ſituation or art, and the ſtate and magnificence of a people and their habitations, will not hold off divine vengeance, eſpecially when he is avenging the injuries done to his people; for, albeit <hi>Tyrus</hi> was ſeated in the Sea, and well fortified with walls; and albeit as all their merchants were Princes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 23.8. ſo their houſes (for moſt part) were ſtately Palaces: Yet when God reckoneth for this ſin, <hi>I will ſaith he, ſend a fire upon the wall of Tyrus, which ſhall devour the Palaces thereof.</hi>

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:114928:190"/>
had moſt occaſion to let it out againſt <hi>Judah</hi>) whom they purſued with the ſword. This their carriage is amplified. 1.

Such as are apoſtates and falſe brethren to the Church, will be given up to as great and many provocations as any, that ſo all may ſee the fruit of their apoſtacy, and themſelves may be ripened for deſerved vengeance; for, <hi>Edom</hi> the apoſtate, hath <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> becauſe of which, the Lord will <hi>not turn away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> 2. Whatever be the other provocations of apoſtates, they will be ſure to be perſecutors of the bleſſed ſeed; and whoever perſecute them beſide, they will be the bittereſt; And this is Gods ſpeciall quarel againſt them, as it is here againſt <hi>Edom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did purſue his brother with the ſword,</hi> and did <hi>tear</hi> as a beaſt doth his prey, and that without all pity. 3. Such as are apoſtates and have a cruel and bloody diſpoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the people of God, may (in Gods holy and wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence) get opportunity to vent their malice; and God may bring his people at under, if it were but to diſcover and try ſuch; for, <hi>Edom</hi> wants not an opportunity to <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue</hi> and <hi>tear his brother.</hi> And albeit he was made to ſerve his brother, yet God permits him to break the yoke (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the prediction, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27: 40.) that he may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what is in him. 4. As no relation to the people of God will ſtay the furie of Apoſtates, nor will one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily or Womb ever make the two ſeeds one; So the Lord will not forget theſe relations, that he may aggravate their ſin thereby; for, it is put upon his ſcore, <hi>he did purſue his
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:114928:191"/>
brother,</hi> that is, the poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who lay in the ſame womb (and that at one and the ſame time) with <hi>Eſau</hi> their Progenitor. 5. Natural affection in men toward their relations, is commendable in the ſight of God, and he will make it a quarrel when they do not evidence it by effects; for, it is a quarrel againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> that <hi>he did caſt off all pity,</hi> or <hi>corrupted his compaſſions</hi> or <hi>bowels</hi> toward his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. 6. When men turn Apoſtates from God and his Covenant and truth, the Lords people needs not truſt any thing to theſe affections which ordinarily are moſt deeply imprinted in them (as in all men by nature) for, they will not onely loſe them all, but their affection will degenerate into extream and cruel hatred; for, <hi>Edom did caſt off all pity,</hi> or <hi>corrupted his compaſſions,</hi> and in place thereof, <hi>his anger did tear.</hi> 7. The Lords people are not to expect that any length of time will mollifie the rage of Apoſtates and Perſecutors, or that their lying by at any time doth flow from any change of their diſpoſition: but as they are cruel at all occaſions, ſo their wrath is irreconcilable; and when they are moſt quiet; they are but waiting for an opportunity to do miſchief; for, <hi>his anger did tear perpetually,</hi> when he had occaſion, <hi>and he kept his wrath for ever.</hi> 8. Though God may long for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear perſecutors, even the worſt of them; yet their cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will at laſt bring vengeance to their own doors, to the utter undoing of what is moſt flouriſhing among them; for, <hi>I will ſend a fire upon Teman, which ſhall devour the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Bozrah.</hi> He will ſend his conſuming vengeance to burn from City, to City. Which accordingly was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> as Hiſtories do record.</p>

As for this cruelty of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the inhabitants of <hi>Gilead,</hi> it was founded on an old quarrel. And it appeareth, that that Land did of old belong to the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> before that the <hi>Ammorits</hi> (whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> diſpoſſeſſed) took it from them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 11.13-24. and therefore on all occaſions they contended with <hi>Iſrael</hi> about it, but injuſtly, ſeeing that they incroached upon nothing that was then in the <hi>Ammonites</hi> poſſeſſion, but did onely caſt out the <hi>Amorites</hi> out of <hi>Gilead,</hi> who were a people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for deſtruction.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> (in whoſe days <hi>Amos</hi> prophecied) did terrifie them, and cauſe them to bring gifts to him, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26 8. and <hi>Jotham</hi> his Son did defeate them, and make then tributaries, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 27.5, 6. Yet it ſeemeth that this final overthrow was given them by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> as Hiſtories do mention. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As many as have outward relations to the Church of God, will be found guilty of many ſins; and eſpecially of cruel perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and ripe for plagues, as of any other people in the world; for, <hi>Ammon</hi> was alſo a friend, being deſcended from <hi>Lot,</hi> and yet he hath <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> for which God <hi>will not turn away the puniſhment thereof,</hi> and he is alſo an enemy to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. As God abhorreth
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:114928:192"/>
all cruelty, ſo eſpecially that which is exerciſed againſt the weaker Sexe, and innocents; for, it is his quarrel, <hi>they have ript up the women with child of Gilead,</hi> and ſo cruelly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mothers, and the young ones. 3. Albeit that men count it their glory to be able to remove ancient land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and to enlarge their dominion; yet it is a ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God ſo to do, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.14. and 27.17. And it is a great aggravation of their cruelty, that they ſhould cut off, and cruſh and undoe ſo many, onely that themſelves may have more room in the world, and more large domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; for, it is his controverſie that they did this, <hi>that they might enlarge their border Senacherib</hi> gloried that he was good at this, <hi>of removing the bounds of the people, Iſa.</hi> 10.13. And God ſuffered his ſons to paſſe over the bound of their duty, and kill him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37.37, 38. 4. When men do with cruelty and violence uſurpe upon others, God is provoked to make them loſe what was their own, as well as that which they purchaſed ſo ſinfully; for, becauſe of this <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>kindle a fire in the wall of Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> &amp;c. It brings calamity and deſolation to their own Country and Cities. 5. Judgements upon wicked and cruel men will have much of Gods wrath in them, and they will come ſuddenly and violently, and be accompanied with much terror and confuſion; for the calamity ſhall be like <hi>a fire</hi> which <hi>devoureth</hi> all, as being inflicted in the burning indignation of God, and they ſhall be conſumed <hi>with ſhouting in the day of battell;</hi> that is, in the fury of war, wherein there ſhall be dreadful ſhoutings of aſſailing ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of affrighted people, and <hi>with a tempeſt in the day of the whirlewinde,</hi> that is, the calamity ſhall ſurprize and overwhelme them like a tempeſtuous whirlwinde: All which ſheweth how ſweet it is to have peace with God in a ſad and boiſterous time; for it is the want of this that maketh this condition ſo dreadful to them. 6. Kings and great ones will be ſo far from helping theſe whom they draw to ſin with them, and idols ſo unable to help theſe that worſhip and truſt in them, that themſelves ſhall be made eminent ſpectacles of juſtice, and monuments of the power of the true God, and of the truth of his word; for, <hi>their King</hi> (or <hi>Malchom) ſhall go into captivity, he and his Princes together, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>In this Verſe <hi>Moab</hi> is chalenged; and the Lord threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens not to ſpare them any longer. And that becauſe of their many and multiplied ſins, and particularly, becauſe of ſome horrid cruelty committed by their King (as would appear) upon the body of the King of <hi>Edom,</hi> whoſe bones <hi>he burnt into lime,</hi> that is, into ſmall white duſt like unto lime, or (as ſome conceive) he made indeed lime of it, to plaiſter his houſe, that ſo his cruelty might be ſatisfied. This fact of the King of <hi>Moab</hi> is applied by very many to that which is recorded, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.26, 27. as ſuppoſing,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:114928:193"/>
that the King of <hi>Moab</hi> being beſeiged by three Kings, did attempt to break through into <hi>Edoms</hi> Campe; (either becauſe it was weakeſt, or becauſe he had greateſt indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt him, for joyning with <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> to whom he was yet ſubject in this quarrel) but failing in the attempt, he took the King of <hi>Edoms</hi> Son who was either new taken, or before that time in his power, and burnt him. But it ſeems rather that that Hiſtory ſhould be underſtood of the King of <hi>Moab's</hi> offering of his own Son in a barbarous Sacrifice to his idols, imploring their help in his extremity: And beſide, the heire of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom could not well be called <hi>the King of Edom,</hi> while his father was yet alive, and in the Camp. Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that this chalenge relates to ſome other act; and that the King of <hi>Moab,</hi> either when he went to avenge himſelfe on <hi>Edom,</hi> (after theſe three Kings had raiſed their ſeige, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 3.27.) or at ſome other time, did let out his fury upon the very bones of the dead King, either after he had ſlaine him, or being dead before, he digged them out of the grave. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods providence and dominion is univerſal in the world; not onely to avenge wrongs done by heathen Nations unto the Church, but to take order with the wrongs done among themſelves; for he threatens to reckon with <hi>Moab</hi> for what he did to <hi>Edom.</hi> 2. The Lords having a ſad and juſt quarrel againſt men, will not aſſoile nor excuſe others who do them wrong; for, he hath much to ſay againſt <hi>Edom,</hi> Chap. 1.11. and yet <hi>Moabs</hi> fault is not the leſſe. 3 Barbarous and inhumane cruelty is odious to God, and the fruit of much growth and ripeneſſe in ſin; for, here it is the reſult and height of <hi>Moabs three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> for which the Lord <hi>will not turn away the puniſhment thereof.</hi> 4. It is in particular an hateful and barbarous cruelty that is exerciſed againſt the dead bodies and graves of men; for, this is chalenged here, that <hi>he burnt the bores of the King of Edom into lime.</hi> And if God will not paſſe over this, when it is done to a prophane man, how much more will he avenge it, when it is done to the bodies of his Saints and Martyrs. 5. Cruelty is ſo much the more odious to God, when it is exerciſed by kinſmen and friends, againſt theſe to whom they have relation; for, <hi>Moab</hi> was alſo a kinſman to <hi>Edom,</hi> and therefore his cruelty is the more hainous.</p>

What ever men may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect by cruel policies, which they uſe either to avenge, or ſecure themſelves for the future; yet it will certainly bring home terrible judgements upon themſelves, and will not availe againſt God, when he purſueth; for, how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable ſoever <hi>Moab</hi> thought to make himſelf by that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid fact; yet that availes not, but even becauſe of that, I (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will ſend a fire upon Moab</hi> &amp;c. 2. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cruel Nations deſerve not onely to be afflicted, but to be utterly conſumed; for, ſuch is the threatning, they ſhall be <hi>devoured</hi> and <hi>die.</hi> 3. Albeit any kinde of death be dreadful enough to theſe againſt whom God hath a quarrel; yet it is a ſad calamity and judgement, and an addition to the ſtroak upon them, when they are cut off in the terrible confuſion and heat of war, in a ſtorme and ſack by enemies; for, it adds to this calamity, that <hi>Moab ſhall die with tumult, with ſhouting, and with the ſound of the trumpet,</hi> intimating that they ſhould not get quarters or conditions of enemies, but ſhould be cut off in the fury of war. 4. It is a ſad judgement on a Nation, and por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the ruine thereof, when it is left deſtitute of Rulers, or they are cut off; for, it adds to the calamity, <hi>I will cut off the Judge from the midſt thereof</hi> &amp;c. 5.

if it were even on Kings and Princes and the greateſt of the world who provoke him; yea even albeit they had ſo much power as to attempt, and proſper in a rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who are over them; for albeit the King of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab</hi> did ſucceed (after ſome difficulties) in his rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. yet God paſſeth his word for cutting him off; <hi>I will cut off the Judge from the midſt thereof, and will ſlay all the Princes thereof with him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 6.

for, when the word inculcates their duty upon them, and yet they reſolve to goe on, they cannot but at laſt loath and hate it. 5: Albeit men will not want pretexts and ſhifts to palliat their ill courſes, and harden them in them, notwithſtanding the admonitions of the word; yet all theſe are but deceiving lyes, and ſnares to miſlead them, and will be ſo far from juſtifying a ſinful courſe, that they heighten Gods quarrel againſt it, and againſt ſinners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it; for, it is added as a part of the quarrel, <hi>and their lyes cauſed them to erre.</hi> Where by <hi>lyes</hi> I do not ſo much underſtand their idols, and fair expectations in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, which did draw them away, as their pretences and excuſes, whereof they wanted not abundance; and that was a judgement upon them: for hereby they were confirmed in their defection, and at laſt ſhould be miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſappointed, when all theſe were found vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous. 6. However men labour to juſtifie their corrupt courſes by the example and practice of their Progenitours; yet that will not extenuate, but rather aggravate ſin, and ſerve ſuch ſinners, heirs to the ſins of their fathers which they imitate, and to the puniſhment deſerved thereby; for this is one particular pretence, whereof he makes a chalenge, that they were miſled by <hi>the lyes after the which their fathers have walked.</hi> Sin is ſo much the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as it is hereditary, <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. 7. The righteous Lord will not onely not ſpare his people when they ſin, but will make their outward lot as ſad as the lot of others whom they are like in ſin; and ſo much the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as their deſtruction is accompanied with ſad ſtroaks on his own precious intereſts; for, he threatens them with the ſame judgements that came on others, <hi>I will ſend a fire upon Judah, and it ſhall devour the Palaces of Jeruſalem;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the Temple was chief, and this might make their ſtroak ſad.</p>

With injuſtice and oppreſſion, appearing in ſeveral particulars; namely, that they were given to bribery, to the perverting of juſtice, ſo that for ſilver they would ſell the man that had a righteous cauſe, into the hand of an unjuſt oppreſſour; Yea, for a very ſmall gift, they would betray the right of the poor who had nothing to give them: and that they thirſted to have the poor under their feet and oppreſſed, and did ſubvert and overthrow peacable men in their courſe and cauſe. 2.

Such as do backſlide from God, his pure worſhip and truth, will ſoon be given up to many and multiplied groſſe iniquities, which may diſcover what are the fruits of theſe courſes in Religion which they chooſe, &amp; refute all their pretences juſtifying the ſame; for, Apoſtate <hi>Iſrael,</hi> hath <hi>three tranſgreſſions and four,</hi> for which God will not ſpare them: And the Lord inſtanceth theſe chiefly in groſſe ſins againſt the ſecond Table, that they who would not ſee their ſin in corrupting Religion, might read it here, and might diſcerne what were the fruits of a falſe Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. 2. Circumvention of men in their righteous cauſe, and the perverting of juſtice, are cruel merchandizing and ſelling of men, and ſins for which God is provoked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a whole Land; for, ſo are they here called, <hi>they ſold the righteous, and the poor;</hi> and becauſe of theſe corruptions
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:114928:196"/>
of their Judges all <hi>Iſrael</hi> are threatned. 3. Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not onely a great evill of it ſelfe, but the root of much evill and miſcarriage, and particularly in Judges, who being led thereby, doe readily pervert juſtice; for, it is <hi>for ſilver</hi> and advantage, that all theſe diſorders are committed. 4. Men are not advanced to places of power and authority, that they ſhould enrich themſelves by all the ſhifts they can, or to decide in cauſes according as they are byaſſed with bribes; but to execute juſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially to all; And when it is not ſo, God will make a challenge of it; for he challengeth here, that <hi>they ſold the righteous for ſilver.</hi> 5. When men are addicted to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, and once accuſtomed to pervert juſtice for bribes, they will eaſily be drawne over to doe wrong, by a ſmall tentation; like a harlot, who having once proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute her chaſtity, will be ſo ſhameleſs at laſt, as to take any price; for they will ſell <hi>the poor for a paire of ſhooes</hi> (or, a meane price) before they want altogether. 6. Albeit the poore finde few to doe for them, yet God will owne them in their righteous cauſe, and will reſent the injuries done unto them; for here he challengeth men for the wrongs they doe them. From <hi>verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. The Lord takes notice of mens affections unto, and their aſſiduouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in ſinne, when they are watching all occaſions, and reſtleſſe till they carry their point; for he marks that they <hi>pant after the duſt of the earth on the head of the poore.</hi> The Lord ſeeth not onely who ſinne, but who are driven to it through the violence of tentation, and who are eager and panting to be at it. 2. It is a plague upon men, that they want not their owne toyle and vexation in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne; and yet all that toyle will not reclame them, nor make them give over; for they <hi>pant</hi> and are breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe with eagerneſſe, and yet they goe on; ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.5. 3. The cruell deſignes of oppreſſors are hatefull to God, when they are not content to pill the poore, but will have them utterly ruined and cruſhed; for it is his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that they <hi>pant after the duſt of the earth on the head of the poore,</hi> that is, they are never at reſt till they get the very head of the poore on the ground among the duſt, that they may tread on it; or till they bring them under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame calamities and ſorrow, cauſing them to put duſt on their head, as was uſual in great diſtreſſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19.

                        <hi>Job</hi> 2.12. and elſewere. 4. It is the commendation of men to be peaceable and meek, not given to contention, and modeſt in proſecuting of their rights, when they are called to contend; for ſo much is imported in their name, who are here owned of God, they are the meek. 5. Mens modeſt and peaceable behaviour will not reſtraine wicked ones from troubling and ſtudying to overthrow them by fraud or force; for they <hi>turn aſide the way of the meek,</hi> that is, they ſupplant him, and doe overthrow his courſes and enterprizes, as if a man were turned out of the way wherein he is walking. 6. The more modeſt and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men are, and the more meekly they carry themſelves under injuries, the Lord will owne their quarrel the more; for he doth here take their cauſe in hand, and challengeth theſe oppreſſors that they <hi>turne aſide the way of the meeke.</hi> 7. Inceſt is an abominable and odious ſinne, and yet they who give way to any ſinne, though it ſeeme more cleanly, may be given up to that alſo; for where covetouſneſſe, fraud, and oppreſſion had place, there alſo <hi>a man and his father will goe in unto the ſame maid.</hi> Delighted in ſins may draw on other ſinnes, at which at firſt men may be ready to ſtartle. 8. Sinne in the viſible Church is not onely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in it ſelfe, but as it tends to the diſhonour of God, when it is committed by theſe who have his name called upon them, and who will needs pretend they are his dear people, notwithſtanding all they do; for it aggravates their ſinne, that it was done <hi>to profane my holy name,</hi> ſaith the Lord.</p>

                     <p>The third particular ſinne laid to their charge, is, their joyning of oppreſſion with Idolatry, and ſeeking to palliate it by their corrupt worſhip; for they not onely took and detained the poore mans pledge, contrary to the law, and did unjuſtly fine men and exact money of them; but when they had done ſo, they durſt goe to
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:114928:197"/>
their Idols Temples and their Altars, to worſhip, and thought all well enough if they employed the unlawfull purchaſe in ſacrifices and feaſts before their Idols, <hi>Whence learne</hi> 1. The Lord abhorreth cruelty, even in mens pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of their rights, againſt the poore; for ſo much doth the Law againſt detaining of the poore mans pledge, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26, 27. teach, for the violation whereof they are here challenged, <hi>they lay themſelves downe upon cloaths laid to pledge,</hi> that is, they not onely detained them, but did weare and make uſe of them. 2. Idolatry in worſhip, and corrupt converſation are very neere in kin, and will agree well together; for, worſhipping of that which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted their God (who was not the true God, who would not be repreſented by their calves) and their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Altars, doe ſuit well with detaining of pledges, and condemning of men unjuſtly. Which ſhould warne the followers of the true Religion, that they doe not put a blot upon it by ſuch courſes. 3. As Idolatry is a very licentious way, for they <hi>lie downe</hi> there, (as was the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome at Feaſts, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23.41.) and <hi>drink wine,</hi> and are ſtill at Feaſts in their Idol ſervice; So ill purchaſe is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ill ſpent, and employed in Idolatry, and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the like; for ſo did they with their pledges and fines. 4. It is an high degree of impiery, when men dare avow ſinne before, and in worſhipping of that which they ſuppoſe to be a deity; for it was their great preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that <hi>they lay themſelves downe upon cloaths laid to pledge, by every Altar, and they drink the wine of the condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the houſe of their God,</hi> ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23, 24. 5. It is alſo yet higher preſumption, when men doe think that outward ſhewes or performances of Religion (whether it be true or falſe) are ſufficient to expiate, or cover their groſſe oppreſſions or iniquities; for in this alſo they ſinned, that they thought all well enough, if they came and made offerings to their Idols of their unlawful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; Which was a great errour, had the way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion been even pure and and according to the rule, as it was not; ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.8, 9, 10, 11.</p>

                     <p>The fourth particular ſinne charged upon them (and which is an aggravation of their other iniquities) is their ingratitude in thus ſinning againſt God, who had heaped upon them mercies, both temporal, <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, <hi>v.</hi> 11. The temporal mercies conferred upon them were, 1.

From <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Ingratitude is the great ſinne and aggravation of all the other ſinnes of the viſible Church, when mercies will not doe at them, either to prevent ſinne, or make their heart melt for it when it is committed; for this is the aggravation of all their ſinne, that notwithſtanding this their carriage, <hi>yet I deſtroyed the Amerite before them, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the Lord. 2. As the Lord is able to overcome the greateſt and ſtrongeſt of Nations, and will quite root them out, if they ſtand in the way of his peoples mercie; ſo deliverance from potent and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty enemies is an obliging mercy; and the greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties there be in bringing about deliverance, the more of Gods power and love, and the more obligation to duty ſhould be read in it when it comes; for albeit <hi>the Amorites height was like the height of the Cedars, and he was ſtrong as the Oakes,</hi> and ſo were ſtronger then <hi>Iſrael, yet I</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>deſtroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath;</hi> or, did quite extirpate them out of that Land, as a tree that is taken away root and branch: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:114928:198"/>
                        <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſinne was the greater, who received ſo notable proofe of love, and yet ſinned againſt God. 3. The Lords ſore ſtroakes on wicked enemies becauſe of ſinne, and for the Churches good, ſhould be laid to heart, to ſtirre her up to duty who is more kindly dealt with; for, ſo much alſo may be gathered from this challenge and aggravation of their ſinne, that ſince the Lord had made the Land to ſpew out theſe Nations root and branch for ſinne, it was abominable in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who were put in their room, to grow as ill or worſe. From <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Albeit wee be ready to forget greateſt mercies, and to deſpiſe them when they are paſt, yet they ſhould never be forgotten, but kept in remembrance, to binde us to our duty: And when we grow negligent herein, God will not forget to inculcate them, to aggravate our ſinne; for albeit this his kindneſs in redeeming them from Egypt was forgotten, and out of date in their account; yet God mentions it on all occaſions, as a mercy which did yet oblige them, and which would not faile to make up their dittay when they ſinned; <hi>Alſo I brought you up from the land of Egypt.</hi> 2. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the Lords people in their diſtreſſes may be ready to ſay, <hi>wherein haſt thou loved us?</hi> yet even a wilderneſſe-condition may have much obliging mercie in it, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which it is great ingratitude to ſleight, and not to walk anſwerably; for it commeth in alſo as an aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſinne, <hi>I led you fourty yeares through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> His protection, proviſion, and ſuffering of their manners there, were mercies not onely to ſweeten the hardſhips of that lot, but to oblige them to God through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all their generations. 3. Whatever may be the Churches thoughts of a preſent afflicted condition, yet the iſſue of the worſt of her lots will be full of obliging mercies; for ſo is here imported, that their wandering in the wilderneſs had a good iſſue, <hi>to poſſeſſe the land of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morites.</hi> And theſe onely are named of all the Nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe they were moſt potent, as <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>

                     <p>In proſecuting of this challenge and aggravation of their ſinne, the Lord ſubjoynes ſome ſpiritual mercies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them alſo.

And it may be alſo that by theſe are underſtood the ſons of the Prophets, who in their youth were bred under more ſtrict diſcipline for that holy calling. Upon all this the Lord inferreth, that ſince theſe inſtances of his mercy were ſo clear as their conſciences could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the truth of them, <hi>v.</hi> 11. they did injuſtly aggregage iniquities formerly laid to their charge; And particularly theſe ſpiritual favours ſhewed unto them, did render their carriage odious, in that they not onely made not right uſe of them, but made the Nazarites contradict their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and break their vow, by giving them wine to drink, contrary to the Law, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.2, 3. and did prohibite the Prophets to reprove their ſinnes freely, or did trouble them if they did it. From <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>Learn</hi> 1. Whatever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward favours are conferred upon a people; yet ſpirituall benefits ought to be looked on as chiefe mercies, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially obliging; Therefore doth the Lord adde theſe to the former, as compleating the mercy of their outward deliverance, and adding much to the ſinne of their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. 2. Whatever be a corrupt peoples eſtimation of faithfull Miniſters, ſent to reveale the word of God unto them; yet the Lords ſending of them is a ſpeciall mercy; for it is one witneſs for him, pleading againſt their ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, that he <hi>raiſed up Prophets</hi> among them. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.14, 15. 3. It ſhould not occaſion a peoples contempt of Miniſters, that they are men like themſelves, and choſen from among themſelves; but it ſhould rather oblige a whole Land to God, that he raiſeth up faithfull and eminent inſtruments of them; for he rehearſeth it as a mercy ſhewed unto them, <hi>I raiſed up of your ſons for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:114928:199"/>
4. It is a mercy which ſhould oblige a land, when they have not onely ſchooles of Prophets, and hopes of a ſucceeding miniſtery, by young men their ſeparating themſelves from worldly delights and incombarances, that they may fit themſelves for that calling; But when there is purity and holineſſe among them, and ſome eminent paterns of it to ſtir up others; for, ſo much is imported in this, <hi>I raiſed up of your young men for Nazarites.</hi> 5. Albeit that wicked men take no great notice of Gods mercies toward them, yea and often times do quarrel and miſtake them; yet their conſciences will plead for God, that his mercies are reall and true mercies, and that he doth them good indeed, and doth not onely ſay ſo; for, <hi>is it not even thus,</hi> (to wit, that I have done to you as I ſay) <hi>O ye child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</hi> From <hi>v.</hi> 12. learn 1. Not onely temporal, but even ſpiritual favours of ordinances and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to piety, will not worke upon a naughty people; But the more kindely they are dealt with, they will bewray their perverſity the more; as this carriage of the Iſraelites doth teach. 2. It is a horrid ſin and hainous abuſe of Gods kindneſſe, when men will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not be holy themſelves, but do hate and oppoſe and cruſh it in others, that they may not obey the Law of God more then themſelves; for, ſuch is this challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them here; <hi>But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink.</hi> 3. It is alſo an abuſe of great kindeneſſe, and a ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt mens own mercies, when they will oppoſe, and hinder or moleſt the meſſengers of God, in the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their truſt toward them; for this was alſo the ingrate carriage of <hi>Iſrael; and commanded the Prophets ſaying, prophecy not,</hi> whereof this ſame Prophet had experience, chap. 7.12, 13.</p>

<pb n="388" facs="tcp:114928:201"/>
following purpoſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord condeſcends to chooſe a people to himſelfe, it is his way to prevent them in their low condition, by his goodneſſe, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a dominion over them and engage them to be his, by many mercies ſhewed unto them; for, ſuch was his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Iſrael; <hi>he brought them up from the land of Egypt,</hi> where they were in bondage, and upon this he grounds his plea and chalenge. 2. A delivered and dignified people do ofttimes ſo carry themſelves, as God hath much to ſay againſt them; for, there is <hi>this word which the Lord hath ſpoken againſt you, O children of Iſrael.</hi> 3. Such as God hath done good unto, are bound not to ſlight his word; but to heare and ponder what he hath to ſay, though it were even againſt them; conſidering what miſery it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends (if not prevented) to have the word againſt them, and how little it will availe them not to hearken to it; and conſidering what their obligations to God are, and that he can reach them otherwiſe who will not heare the word; Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>heare this word</hi> &amp;c. 4. It is the duty of theſe who would have the word effectual on their hearts, not to fixe their eye upon the baſeneſſe of the inſtruments who carry it, but on God who putteth theſe meſſages in their mouths; Therefore, are they led from looking to this herdman, and to <hi>hear this word that the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> 5. All a peoples reall priviledges, and what they pleaſe to arrogate to themſelves beſide, will not availe them before God, when they provoke him, nor will they be a ſhelter to protect them in their ſlighting of the word; for, ſaith he, <hi>hear this word—againſt the whole family which I have brought up</hi> &amp;c.

The Lords faithfull ſervants muſt reſolve not onely to have much humbling toyle and exerciſe in ſeeking to know Gods minde, and in carrying it unto his people; but alſo to be exerciſed with caſting down of many ſtrong holds and imaginations, which ſinners raiſe up in their hearts, to ruine themſelves by obſtructing the ſucceſſe of the word; for ſo much doth this paines taken to refute their exceptions and deluſions, teach. See 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 9, 2. It is the Lords prerogative to make choyce of what Nation he will to be a peculiar people unto himſelfe, and they are highly honoured whom he ſo chuſeth above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, be their other lots what they will; for, ſaith he, <hi>you onely have I knowne</hi> (that is, choſen and taken ſpecial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of) <hi>of all the Families of the earth;</hi> Whereby is not intimate any injury done to other Nations, but it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates his abſolute ſoveraignty to chooſe whom he will, being debtor to none, and his great mercy to them who are thus reſpected. See <hi>Acts</hi> 14.16. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. 3. Such as doe enjoy ſpecial priviledges, and doe not make right uſe of them, will ſoone come to a great height of iniquity, both for nature and number; for they are guilty of <hi>iniquities,</hi> and there is an <hi>all</hi> of them, <hi>all your iniquities.</hi> 4. When Gods peculiar people do make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and goe wrong, their priviledges turne a great ſnare unto them, filling them with conceeit of their own excellency, notwithſtanding their ſinne and guilt, and hiding from them the odiouſneſs of their ſinne, and the greatneſſe
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:114928:202"/>
of their danger thereby; for, here Gods knowing of them is an exception to be removed and refuted. 5. Whatever may be the dreames of ſecure ſinners, yet they will finde that their priviledges doe aggravate their ſinne, and doe draw on more certaine and ſevere ſtroaks upon them; for, ſaith he, <hi>You only have I known,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will puniſh you for all your iniquities.</hi> Which is not ſo to be underſtood as if he would altogether ſpare others when they ſinne, but that however he may wink at the ſinne of others, yet he will more certainly and ſeverely puniſh them then any other. For 1. Their ſin is more groſſe then the ſinne of any others, and there muſt be more of malice and wickedneſs in it, conſidering the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes they enjoy. 2. There is much ingratitude in their ſinne, which renders it the more odious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. 3. Whereas God is therefore kinde unto a people, that he may be glorified in their holineſs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, it cannot but grievouſly provoke him, when they walk the quite contrary way. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It concerns God to vindicate his owne glory and holineſs by puniſhing them when they ſinne, leſt he ſhould ſeem (by forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) to approve of their ſinne, who are ſo neere unto him by priviledges. 5.

Men are naturally dull and ſlow in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up ſpiritual things; So much do the ſimilitudes made
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:114928:202"/>
uſe of in this and the following verſes, to inculcate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tual things, teach. 2. Whatever be our dulneſſe and ſtupidity, or our conceit of our ſelves; yet our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, when they are put to it, will plead againſt our principles and way, when we think to ſinne againſt God, and yet to doe well enough for all that; So much are we taught by all the queſtions in this debate, wherein the matter is put to their conſciences, however for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they pleaſed themſelves. 3. The root of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts in agreement with God, by being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with him through the blood of Chriſt, and by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame end with him, to wit, to glorifie him and be glorified with him; for, here the ground of Gods walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with men, and of their enjoying the fruits of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar preſence, is in their being <hi>agreed,</hi> at peace together, and agreed upon the ſame end of their walk. 4. Such as are thus indeed agreed with God, muſt reſolve to walk with God, and may expect that God will walk with them; for it is imported here that <hi>two</hi> will <hi>walk together,</hi> when they are <hi>agreed.</hi> By <hi>walking together,</hi> as it is a duty on mans part, I underſtand, 1. That men when they are reconciled with God, muſt yet reckon that they are but upon the way to their journeyes end, and to reap the fruits of friendſhip with God. 2. That they muſt ſet themſelves to be at paines, and to walk, that they may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine this end. 3. That they muſt walk in cloſe and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar communion with God, and longing to enjoy him, both for keeping up the friendſhip, and for influence and furniture for their duty, and his preſence to ſweeten their lots. And by <hi>walking together,</hi> as it is a gracious promiſe on Gods part, I underſtand, that unto ſuch as are at peace with him, and depend on him in going about their duty, he will manifeſt his familiar preſence and favour by many proofes of his love, that he will furniſh them for duty, and be with them in all their difficulties: And that they are bound to beleeve it is ſo, albeit they doe not ſenſibly finde it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Such as pretend that they enjoy God, and his preſence and favour, and yet doe not make ſure that they are reconciled unto him, nor doe walk in his way, will upon ſerious enquiry finde themſelves diſappointed; and they doe provoke God to remove from them any viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence of his preſence; for, ſaith he, <hi>Can two walk
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:114928:203"/>
together, except they be agreed?</hi> that is, your conſciences will tell you the one cannot be without the other; and what outward ſignes of my preſence ye think ye have, they cannot be continued with you, ſince ye do not improve them to your own true advantage.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, whereas they were ready enough to deſpiſe all threatnings as vain, and nothing elſe but the ordinary tone of Prophets, who behoved ſtill to quarrel and threaten, and yet they proſpered well enough under <hi>Jeroboam</hi> their King: the Lord declares, that as a lion or young lion will not roar except he have a prey, or ſee one which he is preſently to leap upon and take; ſo the Lord doth not threaten but where there is juſt cauſe, and where judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to follow. <hi>Whence learne,</hi> 1. It is no new thing to ſee a people ſo plagued, as they ſtand not to contemn and deſpiſe the threatnings of God; for, ſo is here impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Such as are forborne by God, or do enjoy preſent proſperity, they are emboldned thereby to neglect what God ſaith; but it is the hight of obſtinacie, when men are feeling the truth of the word in ſad afflictions, and yet do deſpiſe it, in what it threatens for the future. 2. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lord be abſolute and ſoveraigne, and may yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare, yea and cure even them who prove themſelves otherwiſe incorrigible under threatnings or judgements, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17, 18; Yet in his ordinary procedure, his threatnings do portend a ſtorme, and that judgements are comming, and will come, except they be prevented by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for, <hi>the lions r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, whereas they might alleadge, that albeit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions had come, or ſhould come upon them, yet what needed they keep ſuch a buſineſſe about them, ſince no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was more ordinary then to ſee ſuch revolutions, that all Kingdomes and Nations, as well as they, had their own times of affliction, and after a time their caſe alters again, and they recover? The Lord (to obviate this) declares, 1. That as a bird is not taken on the earth without a ſnare; ſo afflictions upon perſons or nations do not come by chance, nor without his ſpeciall providence. 2. That as a fowler doth not willingly nor uſually (though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he may for want of power to proſecute his purpoſe, and ſo the ſimilitude is not to be ſtrained) take up his net before he catch his prey; ſo neither could Prophets ceaſe to threaten, till either they were taken therewith, and brought as true penitents to Gods mercy, or were given up to juſtice: Nor would rods be removed, till either they were amended or deſtroyed by them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as do contemn and make ill uſe of the threatnings of the word, will readily alſo contemn and harden themſelves under ſad plagues; for, ſo much doth the connexion of this with the former verſe teach; and ſuch as make but ill uſe of rods, would look upon that as the fruit of deſpiſing the word; and till that be firſt mourned for, the other will not be gotten amended. 2. One great diſtemper, and cauſe of mens hardning themſelves under afflictions, is, their unwillingneſſe to ſee an hand of God in them, which would invite and ſtir them up to repent and turn to him, as the onely remedy of their grievances; for, this is the diſtemper here refuted: and we finde it very eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Philiſtines, notwithſtanding all their convictions, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.9. 3. Whatever be the ſhifts of mens hearts, yet it is a clear truth which men are bound to believe and make uſe of, that their afflictions come by the providence of God, that it is his forbearance which keeps them from that gin, and his hand that intraps them; for, in this he
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:114928:204"/>
appeales to themſelves, and preſſeth this truth upon them: <hi>Can a bird fall into a ſnare upon the earth, where no gin is for him?</hi> The ſtudy of this truth is very neceſſary, partly, that men may dreame of no iſſue ſo long as they neglect to turn to God; partly, that they may tremble and be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they have to do with ſuch a party, whoſe anger is dreadful, and in whoſe favour is their life; partly, that they may be patient toward Inſtruments of their trouble, when they ſee God imploying them; and partly alſo, that being reconciled with God, they may be comforted, that his hand and providence is ſupreme in meaſuring out their trouble, who numbers the very hairs of their heads, <hi>Math.</hi> 10.30. 4. It is a judgement on wicked men, that plagues ſent upon them are as <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>gins</hi> to them; for, ſo are they here expreſſed in this ſimilitude; not onely becauſe their own ſins prove a net to catch them in and deliver them to juſtice; or becauſe many times ſnares are their greateſt plagues, when outward favours harden them in ſin; But 1. becauſe their afflictions do ſurprize them inexpectedly, and they are ſtill taken aſleep, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the warnings they get, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24, 45. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their afflictions are plagued to them, and by their carriage under them they draw ſtill on more afflictions, as a bird taken in a ſnare, doth but intangle it ſelfe the more that it indeavours to eſcape. <hi>Doct.</hi> 5. Whatever be the Lords ſoveraignty in grace, to change his diſpenſations toward his people when he pleaſeth; yet ſuch as are ill pleaſed with rough meſſages or judgements, may blame themſelves for their continuance, ſince they are ſent upon an errand, and we muſt do what they are ſent to worke before they be removed: for, <hi>ſhall one take up a ſnare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</hi>

                     <p>In this <hi>v.</hi> the Prophet repeats, and confirmes and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cares what hath been ſaid concerning threatning and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, that ſo he may ſtir them up, and let them ſee their ſtupidity; and 1. As for threatnings, he declareth that
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:114928:204"/>
they in any of their Cities, would preſently feare ſome danger, and gather together for preventing it, if the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſounded the trumpet at an extraordinary time, and gave them the alarme; And why then would they not be ſenſible, when God by him threatned them with his wrath, and that the enemy ſhould come againſt them? 2. As for the evils that had come, or were to come upon them in any of their Cities, he declareth that they could not deny but they were of God, and therefore why did they ſleep ſo ſecurely? <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Alarmes and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from the word, are as terrible as any thing can be, and would be thought ſo if they we well conſidered upon; therefore are they compared to <hi>a trumpet blown in the city,</hi> giving the alarme of an enemies approach. 2. Mens own conſciences may convince them of dreadful ſtupidity, if they feare not when they are threatned; and their ſenſe of common and viſible dangers will plead againſt them, and tell them that they feare God leſſe then any thing; for, ſaith he, <hi>ſhall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be afraid?</hi> where he brings in their feares in ſuch dangers, as witneſſing againſt their ſtupidity, when they are threatned, and puts the matter to their conſciences, if they could excuſe them in this. 3. It would help much to make threatnings effectual, if men would look over theſe who carry them, to God who ſendeth them, and to what they portend; for, ſo much alſo doth this ſimilitude teach: A watchman in himſelfe is not terrible, nor wiſheth ill un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, nor is the ſound of his trumpet in it ſelfe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but as it warneth of the approach of a furious enemy; and ſo is it here. 4. Threatnings do not prove falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmes, but are ſeconded with plagues on theſe who make no uſe of them; and it is very rare to ſee it otherwiſe, but they who debord ſo far as to need threatnings, do alſo provoke God to ſmite; for, the one doth follow on the other here, and Iſrael taſted of both, having before this been viſited with many rods, chap. 4.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to prevent the finall ſentence, all which they had alſo abuſed. 5. Albeit afflictions for ſin be the holy works of an holy God, and acts of juſtice, and ſo <hi>good;</hi> and albeit they do worke for good to the Lords penitent people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.67.71. yet as they are evil in themſelves, ſo they are and will prove an evil to the wicked and impenitent; as here they
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:114928:205"/>
are called, <hi>evil in the City,</hi> or in any of their Cities. For they are ſent to be bitter and croſſe to men who walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to God, and to thwart their corruptions and rob them of their enjoyments; They ſhould alſo diſcover the evil and bitterneſſe of mens departing from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.19. (and where they have not this effect, it will not avail that men finde them evil unto them) Yea they will prove evil to make men worſe and more wicked then they found them. 6. As the not ſeeing of Gods hand in trouble, and that we have to do with him, is a chief cauſe of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage under it; ſo this is an evil not ſoon remedied, and a leſſon not eaſily learned; Therefore, after what is ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 5. it muſt be again inculcate, <hi>ſhall there be evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> 7. Whatever be mens ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and wilfull blindneſſe; yet the Lord hath a witneſſe in every mans boſome, who doth not utterly renounce a deity, that he is the author of afflictions; Therefore doth he poſe their conſciences, to ſee if they could ſhift this, <hi>ſhall there be evil, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> 8. Let men be never ſo unwilling, yet it is their duty never to give over, till they have ſeen God in their afflictions; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Lord ſo preſſe it upon them, as a needful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. For (beſide what is marked of our own advantage and duty, on <hi>v.</hi> 5.) it is our glorifying of God, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his providence, and that not onely in general, but as it ſhines in particular actions; and in particular, to look upon afflictions for ſin, as beſeeming an holy and juſt God; and this would help us to our duty under them.</p>

<pb n="397" facs="tcp:114928:205"/>
ſince they would never let them alone: and in particular, they would little regard him, who was a baſe man, and one of Judah who bare them at little good will: The Prophet in the Lords name declareth (in anſwer to this) that they were rather bound to ſee and acknowledge Gods long-ſuffering and mercy, who would forwarne them of their danger before it came, and for that end imployed his meſſengers, and him in particular, <hi>v.</hi> 7.

For the underſtanding of that general aſſertion, <hi>v.</hi> 7. conſider, 1. God is not bound at all to obſerve this method, but may execute what he pleaſeth, though he have neither reveaved it to men nor angels: onely it pleaſeth him out of his gracious condeſcendence, ordinarly to follow this method. 2. This is not to be extended to all perſons, nor yet to all things, as if he did nothing in mercy, juſtice, or ſoveraignty in all the world, but he did communicate it with his ſervants firſt; But the meaning is, that in inflicting judgements on the Church, he uſually takes this courſe, firſt to advertiſe them by his meſſengers. 3. Albeit this relates eſpecially to the time wherein the Church had extraordinay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; yet this holds ſtill true that the deſert of all ſin is held out in the written word, and declared unto people by their faithful paſtours from the word: ſo that the Church may ſee and know what ſhe is to expect, as well as when ſhe had extraordinary meſſengers. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As divine Doctrine is a myſtery above the reach of reaſon, and to be known onely by revelation; ſo in particular, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Lords wrath be very clearely deſerved by ſinners, yet it is ofttimes a ſecret to them, and not diſcerned till it be inculcate upon them, or till they feel it: Therefore is it called <hi>his ſecret</hi> here. 2. The way to know Gods minde concerning men, is by the miniſtery of his ſervants, either extraordinary, or ordinary, ſpeaking according to the word; for, <hi>he revealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the Prophets,</hi> for the Churches information. 3. Such as would get the minde of God to carry to his people, would become his ſervants, not onely by taking up that office up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his call, and attending on him in it; but alſo by being
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:114928:206"/>
in their whole courſe, devoted to him, that ſo he may bleſſe them in that particular function; for they are <hi>his ſervants.</hi> 4. It is the Churches great mercy, whereof ſhe ſhould make eſpeciall uſe, that God doth warn her of her danger before ſhe fall into it; for, it is held out as their advantage, that ſurely <hi>the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his ſecret unto his ſervants the Prophets.</hi> 5. A people may miſtake and quarrel many diſpenſations of God towards them, which yet do ſpeak his great kindneſſe to them, if it were well conſidered; for, they quarrelled all this freedom, which yet flowed from Gods mercy and long-ſuffering toward them. 6. The word of God is the ſure rule, whereby men may know their duty, and what will be the profit or danger of any courſe they follow; And albeit diſpenſations may ſeem for a time to go otherwiſe then according to the words verdict; yet at laſt, all things will certainly and viſibly be according to what the word ſayth; for, ſo much doth this hold out in general, that it is from the word, whoever carry it, that men may know what God thinks of their way: and ſuch as cleave to the word in duty, may expect that Gods dealing will in due time be according as they are warranted from the word to expect. 7. It is needful work, to ſtir up our own hearts again and again, to ſee God in threatnings, and to read his dreadfulneſſe therein; that ſo we may be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our own ſtupidity, that will not fear his anger, albeit it have not burſt forth in execution: Therefore, is it again inculcate, <hi>The lion hath roared; who will not feare?</hi> 8. There is ſmall cauſe to be offended at miniſters freedome in publiſhing their Commiſſion; conſidering that it is an evidence of their zeal, to be imitate by all, rather then quarrelled; and that they ſtand ſtrictly engaged to be faithful, upon their greateſt perill: for, whereas they could not indure this Prophets freedome, he excuſeth himſelfe with this, that <hi>the Lord God hath ſpoken,</hi> (by giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion) <hi>who can but propheſie?</hi> Whereby we are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand a ſtrong impulſe upon their hearts, with the Commiſſion (though Prophets had that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.9. and conſcience, and love and zeal for God, will ſet all on edge to plead for God, who have his Comiſſion) but that his calling laid a neceſſity on him, were he never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, as, <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.17. And that he was in great hazard,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:114928:206"/>

                     <p>Theſe exceptions being thus removed and refuted, the Lord by the Prophet goeth on to the proceſſe, to accuſe and ſentence them. And for this end forraign Nations about (ſuch as Egyptians and Philiſtines) are called to come and bear witneſſe againſt their ſinne, and to juſtifie the Lord in the judgements that were to come upon them. The ſinnes for which they are accuſed, are horrid tumults and oppreſſion, v. 9. Wherein they bewrayed much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy and voluntarily contracted blindneſſe through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in ſinne, and great inſatiableneſſe, in that they hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up goods taken by oppreſſion, in their houſes. v. 10. He names the <hi>Mountains of Samaria,</hi> though it appeareth there was but one hill on which the City was built, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.24. either becauſe he underſtands the whole hilly Country that depended on that City; or rather (ſince he ſeems to ſpeak chiefly to the ills done in that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) becauſe that hill had ſeveral riſings in it: And ſo he intimates, that in every corner of the City, theſe iniquities were to be found. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever be the vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of a ſinful and corrupt Church; yet their courſe is oft-times worſe then the way of very heathens, and ſuch as they would condemn; for, albeit Iſrael deſpiſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, and theſe among and above the reſt, yet they are called to <hi>aſſemble</hi> and <hi>behold</hi> their great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which they would abhor. In which we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:114928:207"/>
1. Albeit Iſrael would not hear nor could bear theſe threatnings (as appeareth from the former doctrine in this Chapter) yet it is here intimated that the Nations about would ſee they were deſerved, as 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 9.8, 9. 2. How blind ſoever Pagan Nations be in matters of the firſt Table, and of Religion (though even in that, their cleaving to what they choſe for a deity, will aggravate the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of the Church, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10, 11.) yet in matters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and equity, and of the ſecond Table, (which are here ſpoken of) the practice of many of them by the light of nature, may condemn them who have the clear light of the written word, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26, 27. And ſo alſo will the uſe they make of any means that at any time hath been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.41. 3. In particular, theſe Nations of <hi>Egypt</hi> and the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> (of whom <hi>Aſhdod</hi> was a part) were noted and infamous among the very Pagans for luxury and other vices; And yet even theſe, and they who lived in palaces among them, would condemn Iſrael; So is Judah called worſe then Sodom, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16, 46, 47, 48. To ſhew how vile a people who have viſible intereſt in God may grow, when once they decline, even to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of admiration to the vileſt of Pagans; and to ſhew how odious ſin is in ſuch. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The Lord will alſo imbitter the cup of ſuch as provoke him, by making their enemies witneſſes of his judgements upon them; for, it is for this end alſo they are aſſembled, to be witneſſes and ſpectators of what he here threatens to afflict upon them. And the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines</hi> are called to in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; partly, becauſe they had ſeen moſt of Gods glorious actings for Iſrael; therefore now he will vindicate his own holineſſe in their view, that none may think that he who had owned Iſrael, did approve their ſin. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe theſe Nations had been inveterate and bitter e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to Iſrael, and therefore the Lord will add to Iſraels calamities, by letting even ſuch enemies behold that upon them, which would be ſo ſweet a ſight, unto them. See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.10. 3. Times of licentiouſneſſe, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and diſorders, are times of great provocation, both in themſelves and in their effects; for, their great ſinne which he would have remarked, is, their <hi>great tumults</hi> which were ſins in themſelves, and cauſes and occaſions of many other ſinnes. 4. Oppreſſion is one of the fruits of
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:114928:207"/>
licentiouſneſſe and diſorder, which God is highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at; for, the ſame word ſignifieth both <hi>tumults</hi> and <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> or <hi>vexations,</hi> and then it clearly followeth, that there are the oppreſſed. 5. Oppreſſion is ſo much the more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, when it is not committed in the remote corners of a land, but in the midſt of Cities, where juſtice ſhould be executed and bear ſway; for, theſe <hi>great tumults,</hi> and <hi>the oppreſſed are in the midſt thereof,</hi> to wit, of the mountain of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where the City ſtood. 6. It is an horrid aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſinne, when men do voluntarily blind themſelves, and will not acknowledge God, nor his law to be their rule, that ſo they may ſinne without a check: and when through a cuſtom and habit in ſinne, they put out all light and cannot do any thing that is right; for, both theſe are in this challenge, as an aggravation of their courſe, <hi>for</hi> (or <hi>and) they know not to do right.</hi> 7. Whatever courſe men take to ſhift the challenges of the word; yet they ſhould know that it is God with whom they have to do, who cannot erre in what he ſaith, and whoſe challenges and the effects thereof cannot be got ſhifted; therefore it is added, <hi>they know not to do right, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 8. Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion continued in, is a great evidence of a people being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many ſpiritual plagues; And particularly, that they are voluntarily blinded, and hardened through cuſtome in ſinne; Therefore is this challenge not onely ſubjoyned to the former of oppreſſions and tumults, to ſhew from whence theſe evils flowed; but more expreſly it is ſaid, <hi>They know not to do right, who ſtore up violence and robbery,</hi> or goods purchaſed by that means. 9. Much gaine and heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of wealth by oppreſſion, will not aſſoil the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour; nor will mens great ſtate and pomp warrant them to oppreſſe, but will rather make their ſin the more hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, conſidering how inconſiſtent in reaſon the one is with the other, that they ſhould be great men having e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and yet be endleſſe in oppreſſion, and that their ſtately palaces ſhould be filled and defiled with ſuch ill purchaſe; for, it addes to the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that they <hi>ſtore up robbery and violence,</hi> and <hi>that in their palaces.</hi>

                     <p>Followeth the Lords ſentence and threatning, for theſe and other ſins mentioned in the ſentence it ſelfe. The ſentence hath four branches; whereof the firſt (in this <hi>v.</hi>) is, that the Lord will ſurround them and their land with enemies, ſo that there ſhall be no way for them to eſcape: and that neither their power, nor their wealth ſhould avail them, but the enemy ſhould bring down the one and ſpoil them of the other. This <hi>adverſarie round about the land</hi> is chiefly to be underſtood of the Aſſyrians, who it ſeemes invaded them on all quarters, and did break their power and take their wealth. Yet it may be extended alſo to ſignifie, that if any ſhould eſcape their hands and flee, they ſhould finde enemies on all quarters of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about them, ready to intrap them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the condition of impenitent enemies and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, yet God is ſufficient and able to reach them and be about with them; Therefore is this threatning againſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent oppreſſors, begun with <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God.</hi> 2. Men are bound to ſee more in Gods quarrel (and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another thing) then what their enemies do purſue them for; for, the Aſſyrians undertook this war, onely to puniſh <hi>Hoſheas</hi> rebellion, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.4. but the Lord tells them that <hi>therefore</hi> (becauſe of their oppreſſion, and their idolatry, of which afterward) <hi>an adverſarie ſhall be about the land.</hi> 3. Albeit men think they have many ſhifts againſt a day of trouble; Yet God can (and when he is provoked, will) eaſily ſurround them, ſo that they ſhall not eſcape trouble, and make them finde few friends notwithſtanding all their confederacies; for, <hi>an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie there ſhall be even round about the land.</hi> 4 When God imployeth inſtruments of vengeance againſt his incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible people, they will not onely be able to threaten them on every hand, with trouble at diſtance, but alſo to be ſucceſsful in their enterprizes againſt them; for, the <hi>adverſarie</hi> ſhall not onely be <hi>round about the land,</hi> but ſhall
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:114928:208"/>
come in upon them with ſucceſſe, to break and ſpoile them. 5. A peoples power and ſtrength, or their wealth (eſpecially being ill purchaſed) will not availe when God is angry; but as ſtrength will prove weak and be eaſily cruſhed; ſo their ill purchaſed wealth will but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to make Gods vengeance on them conſpicuous in taking it away; it will make their lot under want more bitter then if they had never had wealth; and it will leave the ſting of an ill conſcience behind it to imbitter their want: for, <hi>he ſhall bring down thy ſtrength from thee,</hi> or diſpoile thee of power and lay thee low, <hi>and thy Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> (where they heaped up wealth, <hi>v.</hi> 10.) ſhall be ſpoiled.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond branch of the ſentence is, that few ſhould eſcape in this judgement, but as a lion having taken his prey, doth eat till he be full, and then go away, and ſo the ſhepherd may recover a piece of an ear or two legs which he hath left; So there ſhould be a very few of them left, who ſhould hide themſelves in Samaria, lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under or about beds.

certainly be underſtood of the inhabitants of Samaria, who it ſeems were generally cut off at the taking of the City; for otherwiſe many went into captivity; or, it may be underſtood, that of all the Nation of Iſrael very few eſcaped, but either they fell by the ſword, or were carried into captivity. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Gods judgements and ſuch as he employes to execute them, will be terrible and irreſiſtible, till he have done all his worke: therefore it is declared that it ſhall fare with Iſrael as with a lamb in the mouth of a lion, which no ſhepherd dare reſcue, but muſt be content to gather up what the lion leaveth, as a witneſſe that it is not loſt through his default. 2. Times of judgement upon a land will ordinarily be ſo univerſal, as very few will eſcape; but either by death or captivity, or ſome other wayes, they will drink of that cup; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are they who eſcape compared to <hi>two legs, or a piece of an ear.</hi> 3. Such as in a time of a calamity do eſcape death or captivity, may yet be put to many hard ſhifts in lurking, to avoid them; for, they <hi>are taken out</hi> from this danger, <hi>in the corner of a bed, and in Damaſcus in a couch,</hi> as is before explained.

It appears that this was done by the Aſſyrians, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced their altars and places of worſhip, becauſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:114928:209"/>
did not agree with theirs, though it was idolatrous alſo. But it was <hi>Joſiah</hi> who after that, did quite demoliſh that altar, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 23.15. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as are to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gods minde unto his people, have need frequently to rouze up themſelves, and to be rouzed up by God, to take up his minde and authority in it; therefore in the midſt of his purpoſe, is there a new charge given to <hi>Amos</hi> and the reſt of the Prophets, <hi>Hear ye, ſaith the Lord God</hi> &amp;c. 2. When God is threatning a people, and declaring the cauſes of his diſpleaſure, they have need to be ſtirred up again and again to hear; for, this charge to the Prophets, is not onely for themſelves, but to ſhew to the people what they need alſo. 3. When God is either chaleng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or threatning, it is needful to conſider what his power is to avenge the fault he chalengeth, and to execute what he threatens; therefore is he deſigned in this, <hi>the Lord God, the God of hoſts.</hi> 4. What the Lord doth give his ſervants to hear and underſtand, they are bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it, and that ſo ſeriouſly as they give not occaſion to hearers to ſlight it; for, <hi>hear ye, and teſtifie in the houſe of Jacob,</hi> ſaith he. 5. Albeit men do place their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their idolatrous and corrupt way of religion and worſhip, as thinking thereby to eſcape the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments deſerved by their other ſins; yet this will deceive them, and what was their confidence will prove a land deſtroying ſin with and above the reſt; for, <hi>in the day that I ſhall viſit the tranſgreſſions of Iſrael upon him, I will alſo viſit the altars of Bethel,</hi> as his great ſin. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 48.13. 6. Idolatry once admitted, is ſo hard to remove, that it may continue till a period be put unto it by the utter ruine of a Nation: for, their altar of Bethel continueth, till the Aſſyrians break them and it both. 7. A people once addicted to idotatry, are very averſe and incapable of ſeeing either the evil of it, or the danger that cometh by it; therefore this challenge, and ſentence eſpecially, muſt be <hi>teſtified in the houſe of Jacob.</hi> 8. Such as will not put away idolatry, nor deſtroy the monuments of it, will finde that God will cauſe others (though they were idolaters themſelves) do it upon their coſt and expence; for, God ſent the Aſſyrians upon them, who made <hi>the hornes of the altar be cut off, and fall to the ground,</hi> though they had kept them up with great reſpect.</p>

                     <p>In this firſt article of accuſation, the Lord proſecuts that proceſſe for cruel and covetous oppreſſion, which he had begun, chap. 3.9, 10. And in this <hi>v.</hi> he calls the Nobles and Judges of the chief City Samaria to hear what he had to ſay againſt them for their oppreſſion and cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the poor and meaner ſort; and he laieth to their charge, that they ſtirred up one another, as they had power over the poor by being Creditors or Judges in their cauſes, to poll them, that ſo they might have among
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:114928:211"/>
them wherewith to ſatisfie their luſts: Or, they being Judges, did conſpire with the Creditors and Maſters of the poor, to cruſh them, providing they got a bribe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to make merry. He compareth them to <hi>kine of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi> which was fit place for paſturage, <hi>Num.</hi> 32.4. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.14. becauſe they were not onely fatted, and made brutiſh and inſolent by proſperity (upon which grounds enemies are compared to <hi>bulls of Baſhan, Pſal.</hi> 22.12.) but were alſo become effeminate thereby. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Nobles, Judges and great and potent men, are ordinarily the ringleaders of all provocations in a land, and ſuch as God hath moſt to ſay againſt; for, theſe are underſtood by <hi>kine of Baſhan, that are in the mountain of Samaria,</hi> and eſpecially the Judges, as the purpoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth clear. 2. While <hi>Amos</hi> is directed to call them <hi>kine of Baſhan,</hi> we are not to conceive that he con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>emns and affronts what lawful authority any of them had; for, that is contrary to duty and ſound principles, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 8.9. But he doth onely point out what their courſe was in it ſelfe, and laieth to their charge that they had proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abuſed their place and office, and rendered it and themſelves contemptible. And in particular, by this he would teach, 1. That however great men do ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily deſpiſe miniſters, eſpecially if they be mean perſons; yet their ſinful courſes do render themſelves more baſe and contemptible, notwithſtanding all their grandour; for, whereas they thought little of him, as being an herdman; he declareth that they were yet worſe then he, and but like beaſts; and ſo an herdman was a fit enough meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for them. 2. Albeit alſo great men be readily puffed up by reaſon of their wealth and outward proſperity; yet that affords but poor matter of gloriation; and abuſed wealth doth not augment the honour, but rather increaſe the contempt of the abuſers; for, in oppoſiton to the high thoughts they had of themſelves by reaſon of their wealth, he declareth that they had no more to glory of then beaſts which got a good paſture as well as they; and that all their wealth and greatneſſe did but render them more brutiſh and effeminate. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that men, and eſpecially great ones, be unwilling to hearken to God ſpeaking in his word; and albeit their grandour and proſperity doth but hinder them to hear,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:114928:211"/>
and harden them that they will not hear, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.5. and 22, 21. yet they are bound to hear, and will be made to hear upon their own coſt, if they do it not willingly: for, <hi>hear this word,</hi> (to wit, of the challenge, but eſpecially the ſentence, as the conſtruction of the purpoſe bears) imports that preaching to them needs a preface to atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; that it is even their duty to hear, and however they ſtop their eares, yet God will inforce audience one way or other. 4. Whatever be the proſperity of men, or their apparent ſtability in it; yet they are ſtill in a wofull caſe, ſo long as the word is a party againſt them, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their way, or writing bitter things againſt them for it; for, though they were fat, and ſettled and wanton on their mountain; yet <hi>hear this word,</hi> is ſtill an alarme unto them, and that which may mixe their cup with worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. 5. Oppreſſion is one chief ſin for which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends with a land; and ſpecially when Magiſtrates, who are appointed for the protection and ſupport of the weak and indigent, do rather by fraud or force cruſh them; for, it is the challenge againſt theſe kine of Baſhan, that they <hi>oppreſſe the poor, and cruſh the needy.</hi> The firſt word may ſignifie their oppreſſion by fraud, and the other, their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent oppreſſion and cruſhing them, ſo that they were made utterly unable to ſubſiſt. And ſo oppreſſion is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguſhed, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.14. It is a ſin in any to oppreſſe, and eſpecially in Magiſtrates to oppreſſe their ſubjects, and moſt of all, to oppreſſe theſe who are already miſerable. <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard loſt <hi>Ahab</hi> a Kingdome, and <hi>Rehoboams</hi> oppreſſing humour loſt him ten Tribes. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 34.17. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.1.—13. 6. Albeit the poor and indigent have none to owne them, nor to reſent the injuries done to them; yet God, who is the ſupreme Lord, will not faile to plead their cauſe with the greateſt; for, here he pleads it againſt the kine of Baſhan: and how much more will he plead their cauſe, if they be his own people, and cry to him under oppreſſion? See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Luke,</hi> 18.7, 8. 7. It is a great height of ſin which God will not paſſe over, when men (and eſpecially Judges) dare encourage and ſtir up others to oppreſſe, and dare concurre with them for their own intereſts; for, this the Lord doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially challenge, they <hi>ſay to their Maſters, Bring and let us drink.</hi> 8. It is but a poor benefit men reap by their
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:114928:212"/>
oppreſſion, when all is employed to ſatisfie their luſts; and that is the height of the good that ever men will get of ill purchaſe; that they provoke God yet more againſt them by the ill uſe thereof; for, all they mind in their bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery and oppreſſion, is Bring and let us drink, which was a vice they were addicted to, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.1. And for this the Lord alſo challengeth. 9. Though nature be content with little, and ſobriety and religion would teach men ſo; Yet men devoted to their luſts, are in Gods judgement inſatiable, and have never enough; for, albeit they be like fat beaſts, yet they muſt drink more; and albeit they have much, yet their luſts conſume it all, and they muſt oppreſſe and take bribes, and all little enough to furniſh them wherewith to drink.</p>

or Sabbaticall year) was carried up, or the worth of it in money to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to make holy feaſts, inviting the Levites and Widows thereunto; and the third year they kept it at home, and did diſtribute it among the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, the Stranger, the Fatherleſſe and the Widow, which were among them.

See <hi>Math.</hi> 15.5, 6. 3. This offering of a <hi>ſacrifice of thanksgiving,</hi> teacheth; That no other duty of Gods ſervice can be rightly performed, unleſſe conſcience alſo be made of praiſe. See <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.6. 4. The uſe and allowance of leven in the ſacrifice of praiſe, and that according to the law, Lev. 7.13. cannot be ſo underſtood, as if the Lord in this ſervice allowed any thing which is prohibited under the prohibition of leven in all other ſacrifices, Lev. 2.11. and namely, hypocriſie, errour, and prophanity, which is in Scripture pointed at by the name of leven; for, albeit the Lord do in his Chriſt pardon the great mixture of theſe things, which is in his peoples ſervice, yet he will not allow it in any. But this ceremonial precept concerning leven in theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, may point at theſe things; partly, that leaven is indeed forbidden in all offerings that are burnt upon the Altar to God, (and it was an addition to Iſraels ſinne, if they did otherwiſe, which yet appears not from this place) but in ſacrifices of praiſe, there fell much to the Prieſts ſhare, and much was employed in feaſts: and ſo it was leſſe matter what were mens ſhare and portion, if God got what was his due; partly, that as leaven taketh a time to prepare the dough for baking, Matth. 13.33. and doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

They do not ſerve to warrant a man to deviſe any part of worſhip of his own head, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whatſoever pretence of affection or zeale; for all that were but will-worſhip, and ſo not acceptable: And there are duties abundant in inſtitute worſhip, whereby men may teſtifie all the zeale and affection they can pretend to. But they ſerve to point out that our ſervice to God, and eſpecially praiſe, ſhould be performed out of a free, voluntary and ingenuous diſpoſition; and that favours daily obſerved in Gods dealing toward us, and received by us, ſhould daily put a new edge upon our affections, and engage us with our own conſent to what is our duty: and that out willingneſſe and affection ſhould witneſſe it ſelfe, not by verbal profeſſions onely, but by real offering of our ſelves, and what is ours, to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.12.16. <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The practice of Iſrael in imitating theſe parts of inſtitute worſhip; and the Lords reproving thereof, and giving them up thereunto, may teach. 1. Men in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth or falſhood of a way of Religion, have need to be very attentive and circumſpect, that they be not deceived with pretences or ſhews; for Iſraels way was very plauſible, they did imitate the true Religion in many things: they were very active in their way, and diligent and early about it, and <hi>did multiply ſacrifices,</hi> and they made a great ſhew of zeale and affection in it, they <hi>did proclame and publiſh the free offerings.</hi> All this put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, might eaſily deceive the ſimple, and yet did not at all juſtifie their way. 2.

Mens not conſulting with God in his word, but following their own humours and inclinations, is a crooked rule of Religion; their hears being naturally mad on ill wayes, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts being ready to byaſſe them: Therefore are they upbraided with following this as their rule, that they did ſo and ſo, <hi>for this liketh you, O ye children of Iſrael.</hi> 4. When men once engage in a corrupt courſe of Religion, they wil not readily abandon it again: There is more of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in mens being given up to it, then will eaſily be ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off; for, this exhortation, <hi>Come to Bethel and tranſgreſſe, &amp;c.</hi> and his declaring that <hi>this liked</hi> them, imports that there was no reclaming of them. Which may be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to men not to embarque in the leaſt in ſuch courſes; and may guard us from ſtumbling or thinking a courſe of Religion right, meerly becauſe men perſiſt obſtinately in it. 5. As God is provoked to give up ſuch to their own counſels, as are obſtinate in a falſe religion; So a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is a plague great enough of it ſelf, and it ſpeaks a judgement ſad enough, to be given up to it, conſidering what a ſpiritual plague it is, beſide what it may draw on both here and hereafter. Therefore albeit he threaten elſewhere to puniſh them otherwiſe for this ſinne; yet there he declareth, that he needs no more for a plague, but give them their will, <hi>Come to Bethel, &amp;c. for this liketh you, O ye children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>

                     <p>From this whole challenge in the general, <hi>learn,</hi> 1. When God begins to reckon with a viſible Church, he will finde her guilty not of one, or few, but of many groſſe faults; for, in this proceſſe, beſide the faults formerly challenged, he findes her guilty of this <hi>alſo,</hi> that ſhe is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.6, 13, 15. 2. A courſe of ſin will not prove a thriving way in end to any, but eſpecially to the Church, which the Lord will either make a thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of mercy, or a field of blood; and he hath many rods for that end; for, as they liked their way of ſin, <hi>v.</hi> 5. ſo he <hi>alſo</hi> chooſeth their judgements, and pours out a quivet full of them upon them. 3. When the Lord ſtrikes his Church ſoreſt, and with moſt rods, either together or one after another, yet he doth but hereby call her to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and drive her to his mercy; for, it is his challenge that being under all theſe judgements, yet they ſet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>turning</hi> to him, as the thing he was driving at. 4.

limite the Lord, but he both can and doth drive many to him by rods inflicted for ſin; yet it is no ſmall difficulty (as ſad experience proves) in too many. Conſidering 1. Even ſad ſtroaks are not ſoon felt by every one, or ſo felt as to ſtir them up to any exerciſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.9.2: When ſtroaks are felt, bitterneſſe, reſentment, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſoon attained, and without any pains; but repentance is a more difficult task, and is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impeded by theſe diſtempers. 3. Gods hand is not ſoon nor eaſily ſeen in felt rods, to invite us to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as the onely remedy; or it is but little ſeen by reaſon of our eyeing of inſtruments and ſecond cauſes. 4. When we do in general acknowledge an hand of God in our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, yet we may deceive our ſelves with a deluded conceit of being delivered ſome other way, or by ſome other mean then by turning to him. 5. When we are convinced of the neceſſity of repentance, yet it is not eaſie to attain ſincerity and ſtedfaſtneſſe in it, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 78.34, 35, 36.37. 6. When we deſire moſt ſincerely to repent under calamities, yet it cannot ſucceed till firſt we look back, and mourn for our ſleighting the word, which drew on the rod. 7. In a word, no outward diſpenſation can produce repentance, without the grace of God; but croſſes of themſelves will rather drive men further from it. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. So that all have great need to ſet about this duty in the ſenſe of theſe great difficulties, that they may eye God the more; and they who finde mercy, to get another uſe of trouble, ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſingular grace of God in it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 6. It ſpeaks very ſad wrath on Gods part, and much impenitency on our part, when not onely the ſame judgements continue, but new judgements are inflicted, one after another; for, this variety of rods doth declare that Iſrael had not yet returned to God, and that he was ſtill purſuing them. Such a condition doth declare that no rods formerly inflicted have wrought upon us; that God is ſtill angry, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.12, 17, 21. and 5.25. and 10.4. and that we are walking contrary to God, which provokes him to walk contrary to us, and puniſh us yet ſeven times more, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.21, 23, 24. &amp;c. 7. Such as do not repent nor are bettered by one rod, may alſo abuſe and harden themſelves under never ſo many; for, this was their fault under all of them, <hi>yet have
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:114928:217"/>
ye not returned to me.</hi> Men muſt get the plague of their own heart cured, before any affliction worke upon them; judgements are in themſelves ſtupifying and do harden ſinners, if grace prevent not: and abuſe of one rod draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on more hardneſſe, and fits a ſinner for the abuſe of more rods: ſo that ſtill the longer, it is ſtill the more eaſie to go wrong. 8. Incorrigibleneſſe and impenitency under multiplicity of rods, is a great height of defection in a people, and the cauſe of a ſad controverſie; for, here this is the great challenge God hath againſt them, which draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on yet a ſadder quarrel in the following purpoſe. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.5. and 9.13: <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.3. and 6.29, 30. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13.</p>
                     <p>In particular (that we may enlarge this incorrigiblneſſe from the text) from <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. As famine is a ſad ſtroak, however ſinners think little of their daily bread; (for, here it is mentioned as a rod which might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed them;) So when a people become brutiſh, and will not be led, ſo much as by principles of reaſon, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God, or to take up their duty, nor will take notice of other evidences of Gods diſpleaſure againſt them, it is juſt with him to pinch them by the belly, like beaſts, whom they reſemble in practice; for, they who were <hi>kine of Baſhan, v.</hi> 1. and were ſo brutiſh as to take no notice of Gods giving them up to their own counſels, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. are given up to <hi>cleanneſſe of teeth, and want of bread,</hi> as to a ſtroak which they would feel. And whenever the Lord ſmites a people with famine, they ought to read their own brutiſh diſpoſition in that rod. 2. Such as do abuſe proſperity, and do not maintain the ſervice of God, and his miniſtry, with the good things given to them, it is righteous with him to let them ſmart under want; for, this ſtroak cometh alſo becauſe they did but abuſe plenty to ſerve their luſts, and make them <hi>drunk, v.</hi> 1. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they left his Temple and Prieſts without Sacrifices and maintenance, and employed all theſe on their idols, and to the maintenance of their unlawlul prieſts, <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. 3. It is a ſad lot, and ſpeaks much diſpleaſure from the Lord, when he makes ſtroaks become univerſal, ſo that none can help another; and by ſuch a lot, he would invite ſinners to repentance; for, this adds to the affliction, that it was <hi>in all your cities, and in all your places;</hi> and by this he
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:114928:217"/>
put them to it, if ſo be they would <hi>return.</hi> 4. Sin is for the moſt part ſo deeply rooted in mens hearts, and ſo much affected by them, and God ſo little taken notice of in calamities; that it is no wonder to ſee men ſtarved out of the world, before they will famiſh their idols, and relinguiſh ſin; for, albeit their ſtroak was ſuch, <hi>Yet have ye not returned to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. The longer time that ſinners be warned of judgements, before that ſtroaks be inflicted, it doth heighten their impenitency before the Lord; for, it adds to their ſin, that they had <hi>three moneths</hi> drought before the harveſt came (in which time rain was moſt needed) to warn them of the enſueing famine, and yet it took no effect; <hi>ye have not returned to me.</hi> 2. As Gods providence is ſupreme in ordering all natural cauſes and effects, even in diſpenſing rain as he pleaſeth; ſo it aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates the impenitency of ſinners, when Gods hand is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently ſeen in a ſtroak, and yet he is not ſought unto: therefore it is marked, that he <hi>cauſed it to rain upon one city, and not upon another</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>yet have ye not returned.</hi> 3. The Lord when he pleaſeth, can make as ſmall a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as a drink of water prove a great trial to a people, and cauſe them change their ſtation to follow it; for, <hi>two or three cities wandred to one city</hi> (belike where rain had been) <hi>to drink water.</hi> Such a great pinch was even <hi>Ahab</hi> brought unto, 1. <hi>Kings,</hi> 18.5, 6. 4. It cannot but adde to a peoples ſin, when they are made to feele a ſtroak, and are put to toile by it, and yet make no uſe of it, to ſee Gods quarrel, or turn to him; for, it is his challenge, they were made to wander to ſeek water, and yet returned not. 5. Whatever courſe ſinners take to be rid of troubles, when yet they neglect repentance, it is meet and juſt that they be diſappointed therein; for, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their wandering, yet <hi>they were not ſatisfied.</hi> The wells that might ſupply one city, could not ſupply ſo many. 6 It is the great ſin of men, that being diſappointed in all their expectations, and croſſed in all the courſes they take to be rid of troubles, yet they will not, among the reſt, eſſay to turn to God: for, this is the challenge, that not onely they wanted water, but when they uſed all means they were not ſatisfied, and <hi>yet have ye not returned to me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>

                        <pb n="422" facs="tcp:114928:218"/>From <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Learn,</hi> 1. God hath variety of means whereby to plague men, and to bring upon them any affliction he intendeth againſt them: and particularly, he hath ſeveral wayes whereby to bring on famine. He can arme all his creatures to cut off mens proviſion, one of them after another; he can make the change of aire, and ſmall inſects do that worke when he pleaſeth; for, beſide the drought, <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8. <hi>blaſting and mildew</hi> do cut off their corne, and the <hi>palmer-worme</hi> ſpoiles their gardens, vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and other fruit-trees. 2. Albeit men under a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction have their eye much upon the preſent particular meane of their trouble; yet the removal of that will not availe them ſo long as God is angry: But whatever be the change of providential diſpenſations, the impenitent may expect to meet with trouble; for, as <hi>blaſting</hi> came by withering windes, ſo when that was removed, and they got rain (either after the drought, or in other places where it rained, <hi>v.</hi> 7.) that did not availe, but cold rain and the heat of the ſun after it, begot <hi>mildew</hi> or rottenneſſe. 3. It is a great aggravation of impenitency, when the Lord makes all creatures prove enemies, and every diſpenſation prove a croſſe to men; and yet they will not be driven to make God their friend; for, this is the challenge that under all this, <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>learn,</hi> 1 When one kinde of affliction will not worke upon ſinners, God hath change of rods wherewith to exerciſe them; for, whem famine preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not, he had <hi>peſtilence</hi> and <hi>the ſword.</hi> 2. It is a very ſad and humbling caſe, when the Lord who did gloriouſly appear for his people, by plaguing their enemies, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to put his people in the roome of enemies to feele the ſame plagues. And it is yet ſadder when ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation doth not affect and drive them to God: for, this addes to the affliction, that <hi>I have ſent among you the peſtilence after the maner of Egypt</hi> (pointing, as would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, at that ſtroak, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.8, 9.) and it is ſad that though there was ſuch a ſtrange diſpenſation, <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lard.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.9, 10. 3. Whatever be a peoples duty, yet where God hath a controverſie, their indeavours aganſt their enemies will be to ſmall purpoſe, and will onely contribute to heap miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:114928:218"/>
upon themſelves; and they are bound to ſee Gods quarrel and hand in this; for, <hi>your young men have I ſlain with the ſword, and have taken away your horſes, and I have made the ſtinke of your camp to come up into your noſtrils.</hi> 4. It doth yet adde to a peoples ſin, when the Lord doth chooſe new rods for them, when he by his immediate hand, concurreth with enemies to ruine them, and when theſe who are reſerved, beare the ſad prints of, and warnings from theſe calamities, and yet they will not be induced to turn to God; for, this is his quarrel here, that albeit he not onely made the indeavours of enemies ſucceſsful, but did immediatly ſmite them with peſtilence; and albeit their low condition, by breaking their military force, and the ſtink of their campe, were a warning to them; <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>From, <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. The viſible Church may ſo far debord as to deſerve to be afflicted as ſeverely as the worſt of people: and God may in juſtice inflict what ſhe deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth; for, <hi>I have overthrown ſome of you as God</hi> (ſpeaking of himſelfe in the third perſon) <hi>overthrew Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah.</hi> It needs neither be certainly affirmed nor denied that God did by fire, or ſome extraordinary vengeance from heaven, conſume ſome of them; for, on the one hand that may be true, though it be not recorded in the hiſtory. And on the other hand, the expreſſion may point rather at the meaſure of Gods diſpleaſure, then at the manner of the puniſhment; and it is ſufficient to aſſert that by the many and divers judgements inflicted on them, they were utterly conſumed in ſeveral places. 2. As the Lord is ſtill gracious to his Church and people, to preſerve a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of them in the midſt of utter deſolation, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding great provocations; ſo he ſeeth it meet to cauſe ſuch as are preſerved, bear the marks of common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they may be ſtirred up to make uſe of them: for, ſaith he to the remnant preſerved, <hi>ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning,</hi> intimating what was his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which plucked them out, and what prints of that combuſtion were upon them, whereof they might make uſe of. See <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.2. 3. It is an undeniable proofe of a peoples incorrigibelneſſe, when neither the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of judgements, or of Gods diſpleaſure, or immediate hand in them; nor of mercy remembred in wrath, will
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:114928:219"/>
prevaile with them to make them turn to God; for, this feals up the challenge, that when ſome of them were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown like Sodom, and yet ſome of them were preſerved, <hi>yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>Unto theſe challenges a further threatning is ſub-joined of ſome ſtrange judgements to come upon them. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof, he exhorts them <hi>to prepare to meet him;</hi> that is, (according to that ſpeech, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 31, 32,) either they would ſtrengthen themſelves to grapple with him, and reſiſt his judgements: Or, (ſince they were too weak for that) they would by repentance ſtudy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this ſtroak of an angry God. And this exhortation hath an argument couched in the boſome of it, that as it became them who were <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thus to behave themſelves; So it might encourage them that the Covenant was not yet renounced or made void, but he was their God ſtill. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The incorrigibleneſſe and impenitency of a ſmitten people doth portend terrible judgements yet to come, and doth juſtly procure them. For it is righteous with God to proſecute his begun proceſſe againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danted people (who have ſaid by their practiſe, that they will not receive correction, nor be reclamed, whatever he do) till it be ſeen whoſe word ſhall ſtand, his or theirs, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.28. And it is juſt with him not to reſpect any afflictions that are on a people who make no uſe of them, but ſtill to inflict more plagues, though they had never ſo many before. Therefore doth their incorrigible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe draw forth this ſentence; <hi>Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Iſrael.</hi> 2. When the Lord hath ſmitten a people never ſo ſore, he hath yet more and ſadder judgements to inflict, if they continue impenitent; for, after all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtroaks, he yet threatens, <hi>thus will I do unto thee;</hi> and <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:114928:219"/>
are not ſo much to underſtand, that he will do as he hath formerly threatned v. 2.3. or that he keeps it up, that he might make it ſadder or lighter, according as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves in the matter of repentance. But by this it ſeems he would point out the tetribleneſſe of this ſtroak, in that it is inexpreſſible, and the very nameing of it ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. And if any queſtion what can be added to the judgements formerly inflicted; it would be conſidered, 1. Albeit former judgements have not wrought upon a people; yet there may be hope that Gods purſuing them, may prevaile: Therefore the Lord may adde this to all the former judgements, that they ſhall be plagued with the want of any future bleſſings of rods, and that afflictions ſhall never do them any more good, but ſhall harden them. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.20. and 24.13. 2. Whereas theſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments had wrought ſlowly toward their ruine; He can turn the moth into a lion, and ſpeedily conſume them. See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.12, 14. 3. He can ſend theſe judgements not ſucceſſively one after another, upon a people, but can pour them out all at once, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.22. 4. Whereas mens mindes may be ſupported under a deluge of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calamities; he can break the peace of their minde, can fixe their eyes to pore upon their troubles, raiſe up tentations about them, and waken up anguiſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, as <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.18, 19. <hi>Iob.</hi> 9.18, 27, 28. 5. Whereas notwithſtanding all the former judgements, a people may yet have a remnant preſerved, and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to dwell in their land; He can caſt them out of their land, and make their remembrance to ceaſe, as <hi>v.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.26. 6. Whereas a people under all theſe calamities, may yet continue to be a Church; He can break his ſtaves and unchurch them. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. 7. All theſe calamities formerly mentioned are but temporal; but God can adde to all theſe the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of both body and ſoul in hell. <hi>Doct.</hi> 3. This exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation given to threatned Iſrael, may in general teach, 1. When the Lord is about to ſtrike in great ſeverity, yet he deſireth an interceſſor, and to be prevented; And albeit this will not alwayes hold off the ſtroak (eſpecially when ſome few onely ſet about it, and the body of a people are perverſe and ſtubborn, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.13, 14. &amp;c.) yet it is well pleaſing to him, that the duty be ſet
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:114928:220"/>
about; therefore doth he command it here. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.16. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30. 2. Such as have been much hardened in impenitency, under many warnings and judgements, may yet attain to repentance, if they will know the plague of their own heart, and in time ſet about the duty; for, the exhortation ſuppoſeth that any who are ſenſible of their former obduration, ſhould not deſpair of repentance as impoſſible. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.40, 41. 3. No man but he will indeavour to prevent wrath by repentance, who is ſenſible that he is no party for God, nor able to abide his anger; for, ſo much doth the exhortation import, that if they were not able to ſtand it out, they ſhould ſubmit and repent. See 1.1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11. <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. In particular, theſe exhortations to <hi>prepare to meet God,</hi> holds out the duty of true penitents, in theſe particulars. 1. A penitent ſhould take up God as his party with whom he hath to do, both in judgements, and in performing duties of repentance; for, it is God he hath to do with. 2. He is not to look upon repentance as a duty he will attain to at a fit, but there muſt be preparation and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirring for it, by reall conviction for ſin, much diligence and ſeriouſneſſe; for, they muſt <hi>prepare</hi> for this duty. 3. He muſt make it his care, eſpecially, to prevent wrath by repentance; for, he muſt <hi>prepare to meet God,</hi> comming againſt him with vengeance. Albeit repentance be good at any time, yet a penitent under trouble will finde his ſtroak the ſadder, that it might have been prevented in time: and he will finde his work the more difficult, that the ſtorme is broken upon him. 4. When a penitent hath done all he can by way of duty; yet he is bound to think little of it, as being rather a <hi>preparation,</hi> then any thing elſe; and he will ſo judge of it, if he be reall. 5. Whatever ſenſe he have of ſhort comming, and whatever he be in his way; yet he is bound not to ſtay away, but to creep toward God, and <hi>prepare to meet him. Doct.</hi> 5. The motives and arguments of repentance, here held out, may teach. 1. As whatever guilt and ſad diſpenſations may ſeem to ſay, a true penitent will finde the Covenant ſtanding firme; (as here it is imported to be yet in force, notwithſtanding all their ſin, and judgements for the ſame:) So ſuch as would repent indeed, ought not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be affected with challenges and judgements; but
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:114928:220"/>
ſhould make uſe of faith in Chriſt, and of the Covenant to melt their hearts, and draw them to repentance. And ſuch as do profeſſe an intereſt in God, ſhould be aſhamed to continue impenitent, when he is angry, and not to tremble, and ſeek to make their peace, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clames war againſt them. Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>prepare to meet thy God,</hi> as directing them to make uſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for this end, and inforceing repentance upon them from their own profeſſions of intereſt. 2. As the Lords heart warmeth towards his poor people, and upon this it is that he invites them to repentance (for, he names <hi>Iſrael</hi> twice, as a name that had been deare to him, as <hi>David</hi> did name <hi>Abſolon</hi> in his perplexity, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33.) So the titles and priviledges of a people, ſhould prove an argument of repentance unto them; for, if they be <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ſhould <hi>prepare to meet God,</hi> for ſo did Iſrael of old, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.3, 4. and thereupon obtained that name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.28.</p>

                     <p>A ſecond argument and motive to repentance is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this <hi>v.</hi> and taken from the conſideration of God who is their God, and with whom they have to do; who is here deſcribed from ſuch acts of his power, Omniſcience and Majeſty, as may invite them to repent, and terrifie them if they neglect it. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. <hi>A</hi> right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and taking up of God with whom we have to do, is a notable mean to make us ſerious in our duty, particularly, in repentance; therefore is this argument made uſe of to preſſe the exhortation. 2. It is our duty in meditating on God, not to pleaſe our ſelves with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and common diſpoſitions; but we ſhould have our thoughts elevated and raiſed up, that we may think of him with reverence as becometh, and may thereby be quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to duty: therefore is there a <hi>lo,</hi> or, <hi>behold,</hi> perfixed
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:114928:221"/>
to this doctrine. 3. God hath given ſuch a proofe of his power in making and upholding the hils, as may incourage ſinners to flee unto him, and make him their refuge; and may be a terrour to them, if they ſtand out: and a right obſerver of this work, will read ſuch a leſſon from it; for, this is one argument, <hi>he formeth the mountains:</hi> 4. As the Lords creating of the winde ſhould ſet forth his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and preach repentance unto ſinners, and incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the penitent: So his creating of inviſible ſpirits and the ſouls of men, ſhould teach them to feare him who hath command and power over ſouls, as well as bodies; for, it is another argument, <hi>he createth the winde,</hi> or <hi>the ſpirit</hi> and ſoul. 5. There is no dallying with God in the matter of repentance, who not onely knoweth mans moſt inward meditation, but giveth proofe thereof; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his information, man cannot know himſelfe: for, <hi>he declareth unto man what is his thought,</hi> to wit, by his word, and by wakening of mens conſciences. 6. It is but folly for impenitent ſinners to truſt to any-probable mean of comfort or reliefe, ſeing God can as eaſily turn all their joy, and hope of deliverance, into ſorrow, griefe and trouble, as he can over-cloud a clear morning; for, ſo much is held out in this, that when a morning breaks forth after a darke night, <hi>he maketh the morning darkneſſe.</hi> 7. To be high and eminent will neither aſſoile the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, nor ſet him above God, or above the reach of his hand; for, he not onely reacheth, but <hi>treadeth upon the high places of the earth,</hi> or whatſoever is eminent and exalteth it ſelfe againſt his obedience; whereof his tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the hils is a viſible pledge. 8. The Lord is the fountain of being unto all his creatures, and hath all of them as armies ready to obey his commands; and this alſo ſhould make the impenitent to tremble, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch as make their peace with him: for, it is the laſt argument, <hi>Jehovah, the God of hoſts is his name.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this chapter, the Lord proſecutes what he had begun in the cloſe of the former; and takes much pains to ſtir them up to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that ſo they may prevent their own ruine, and that they may be left without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, if they will not harken unto him. And for this end, in the firſt part of the chapter he laieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them their ſad condition which was approaching, in a lamentation for the utter deſtruction of their ſtate, <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2. and the almoſt utter conſuming of the body of the people, <hi>v.</hi> 3. In the ſecond part of the chapter, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to make uſe of this warning, and to ſeek to God by repentance for preventing of the ſtroak. This exhortation is ſeveral times repeated, and ſeconded with directions how to performe the duty rightly, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to incourage them to it, with challenges for ſin, ſhewing what need there was of it; and theſe preſſed home with threatnings of deſerved judgements, to keep them from ſleighting challenges. And 1. They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to ſeek him, and encouraged from a promiſe of life, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and diſſuaded from their idolatrous courſes, which would bring judgements upon the places where they were entertained, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 2. The exhortation and encouragement are again repeated, with a certification that if they obeyed not, wrath ſhould come upon them, which they ſhould not remedy by their idolatry, <hi>v.</hi> 6. conſidering that (beſide their idolatry.) they were guilty of horrid injuſtice and unrighteouſneſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 7. 3. They are again exhorted to ſeek him, conſidering his power, which appears in his ordinary providence in the world, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and in his doing great thing by unlikly means, <hi>v.</hi> 9. And conſidering what their ſins were, and what they deſerved; wherein he declareth, that they were ſuch as could endure no admonition, <hi>v.</hi> 10. that they were cruel oppreſſors, to raiſe up themſelves, but it ſhould be to no
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:114928:222"/>
purpoſe, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and that he knew their horrid injuſtice, however they did palliat it, <hi>v.</hi> 12. and would therefore puniſh them with judgements, under which they ſhould not dare to mutter, and wherein wiſe obſervers ſhould adore his juſtice, <hi>v.</hi> 13. 4. The exhortation is yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated, and they are ſtirred up really to ſeek good and abandon evil, promiſing them life, and his preſence which now they did but preſumptuouſly boaſt of, <hi>v.</hi> 14. and they are preſſed to prove the ſincerity of their ſeeking by their zeal and affections, and executing of judgement and juſtice; upon which there is hope of mercy held out to that remnant, <hi>v.</hi> 15. otherwiſe, it is threatned that all perſons and places ſhall be filled with ſorrow and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, <hi>v.</hi> 16.17. In the third part of the chapter, the Lord refutes their carnal confidences which made them contemn his threatnings: and namely 1. Their atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcorning of threatned judgements, and their looking to be better dealt with; which he declares was a plague upon them, and would be refuted by the dreadful dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the day of vengeance, wherein one miſery ſhould be heaped on another, to plague them, <hi>v:</hi> 18, 19, 20. 2. Their hypocritical conceit of their external worſhip; which the Lord rejects, ſince (beſide the unwarrantable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe thereof) they walked not ſtreightly in the duties of the ſecond Table, <hi>v.</hi> 21.22, 23, 24. 3. Their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in antiquity and the cuſtomes of their fathers; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whom the Lord declareth that they had corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his worſhip, as well as they who ſucceeded them, <hi>v.</hi> 25.26. and therefore they who had imitate them, ſhould pay for all by their captivity, <hi>v.</hi> 27.</p>

                     <p>In theſe verſes, the Prophet laieth before Iſrael their ſad condition and approaching ruine, in a lamentation
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:114928:222"/>
given and dictate to him by God, thereby to expreſſe his ſenſe of their condition: Wherein it is lamented that the Church and ſtate of Iſrael is fallen, and that without hope of recovery; ſhe being deprived of her members and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and none left to raiſe her up againe. From <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. A peoples obſtinacy and oppoſition to God, and their contemning of better tidings from the word, will at laſt reſolve in ſad newes and lamentations: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be that people rejoice and comfort themſelves in, neglecting God, it will certainly end in bitterneſſe and ſorrow; for, now the wanton and incorrigible <hi>houſe of Iſrael</hi> get <hi>a word againſt them, even a lamentation.</hi> 2. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners are ordinarily ſo careleſſe and ſo deafe, that they have need to be ſtirred up to give attention, even when ſaddeſt news are gone out againſt them; for, they need a call here, <hi>Hear ye this word</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lords faithful ſervants muſt carry hard tidings againſt his people, when they are comanded; and are bound to glorifie Gods juſtice, when it is manifeſted in righteous judgements: Yet their own diſpoſitions are not ſo cruel, but they will be ready to lament for the ſad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which they muſt carry: and it is matter of deep ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, when the Lord enters into judgement, even with his ſinful Church, and people, and rewards them as they deſerve; Therefore is this threatning held forth in <hi>a lamentation</hi> of the Prophet. From <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>learn.</hi> 1. It is the ſad and lamentable fruit of ſin, that it brings a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perſon violently down from their dignities and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, into a gulfe of miſeries; for, it is the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Iſrael is fallen,</hi> which is a violent change to the worſe. He ſpeaks of it in the preſent time, becauſe of its certainty and nearneſſe, and becauſe the lamentation is fitted to the time when it ſhould be ſo. 2. A peoples former flouriſhing condition, and their not meeting with ſuch ſad lots, yea and Gods former tenderneſſe toward them, will not hold off deſerved wrath, it may well make it ſadder; for, though they be <hi>the virgin of Iſrael,</hi> both in reſpect of Gods tenderneſſe toward them (as a man is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his daughter, being a virgin) and in reſpect of their former flouriſhing condition, and that they had been as an untouched virgin in reſpect of total ſubduing (and ſo it is ſpoken of other Nations, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47. 1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 46.11.)
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:114928:223"/>
Yet <hi>the virgin of Iſrael is fallen,</hi> and that maketh her fall the ſadder. 3. Albeit ſecure ſinners (eſpecially in the Church) do ordinarily dreame of a ſpeedy recovery out of their calamities; yet it is no wonder to ſee deliverance long a coming when once God is provoked to ſtrike in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity: Yea it is juſt with God to ſtrike an impenitent Church without hope of recovery, at leaſt for many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; Therefore it is added, <hi>ſhe ſhall no more riſe,</hi> or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, like a weak woman ſo cruſhed with a fall, that ſhe cannot get up again. Which is not to be underſtood as if Iſrael ſhould never recover; for the contrary is promiſed, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.5. and 41.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. and elſewhere: And the original expreſſion is uſed of things which come not to paſſe onely for a time, as 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.23. and 24.7. compared with <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.5. But the meaning is, that however formerly when they were afflicted, they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer again either in the ſame, or in the following genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 13.22.23, 24, 25. and 14.25, 26, 27. yet now it ſhould not prove ſo: But by this ſtroak, the Nation and ſtate ſhould for once be loſt without hope of recovery, and ſhould continue ſo for a long time; as hath been ſadly verified to this day. 4. God when he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, can deprive a people of all refuges; and leave them deſtitute of all helpe, in the midſt of their former enjoyments; for, <hi>ſhe is forſaken,</hi> and that <hi>upon her land, there is none to raiſe her up.</hi> This confirmes her hopeleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that like a virgin cruſhed with a fall to the ground, and wanting help to raiſe her up; ſo ſhould ſhe be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of her ſubjects who in great numbers had poſſeſſed that land, and ſhould have none to recover her out of her difficulties, but ſhe behoved to lie ſtill upon the ground, and not get her ſtate erected again on that land, as formerly.</p>

When God is provoked to let out the wrath that is due to ſin, it will make a ſad and great change, and a great havoke of men; for, ſo it is here, ſcarcely is the tenth man left; <hi>The City that went out by a thouſand, ſhall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred, ſhall leave ten to the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The forme of ſpeech alludes to the dividing of the people under captains of thouſands, and of hundreds. 3. When a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becometh impenitent and obſtinate, it is juſt with God, not onely to ruine them as a State, and break their authority as a Nation, but to break forth upon the body of the people, and conſume them with judgements alſo; for ſuch was Iſraels lot, not onely did they fall as a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, v. 2. but here the body of the people are conſumed. 4. The Lord in greateſt ſeverity, doth yet remember mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy toward his people. Even threatnings againſt them, have promiſes of mercy in their boſome. And in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, no ſad diſpenſation toward Iſrael, doth utterly make void Gods mercy toward them: for, ſo doth appeare here; albeit it be a threatning that they are but <hi>ten,</hi> yet that they are <hi>ten,</hi> is a mercy and promiſe. See <hi>Iſa,</hi> 6.13.</p>

ſo frequently exhorted, and preſſed and directed, in this part of the chapter. In theſe verſes they are, 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and exhorted to ſeek him. 2. They are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged ſo to do, by a promiſe of life, whereby we are to underſtand not onely a ſpiritual life of grace here and glory hereafter, but alſo that they ſhould be delivered from trouble (at leaſt not be totally conſumed by it) and enjoy outward proſperity and felicity, in place of the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which their ſin drew on. 3. They are directed how to ſeek him rightly, to wit, that they ſhould ſeek him in his own appointed way, and not follow their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous courſes. And to this a reaſon is ſub-joined, that the places where their idols were entertained and worſhipped, were to be conſumed by the wrath of God; and therefore it was their folly to follow them. From <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. The Lords ſcope, when he threatens moſt ſeverely, is to drive his people to repentance, that they may be fit for mercy; Therefore this exhortation comes in with the particle <hi>for</hi> (or ſince it is ſo, this is the thing I drive at) <hi>ſeek me.</hi> Unleſſe we faſten upon this, we will either but deſpiſe threatnings, ſo long as we can, or become heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe when are ſenſible of them. 2. As to enjoy God will be the chiefe deſire and aime of penitents, and not to be freed from trouble onely: So however ſecure ſinners glory much of their enjoying of God; yet when trouble is bleſſed to ſet them on worke, they will finde their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and ſee that he is departed. In both theſe reſpects are they directed to <hi>ſeek</hi> God as their chiefe deſire, and him whom they had loſt in their ſecurity. 3. Albeit ſenſible ſouls finde the Lord abſent from them, through their own default; Yet that ſhould not deterre them from ſeeking and purſuing after him again; for, to ſuch is the command, <hi>ſeek ye me.</hi> To be made ſenſible of a diſtance, and of abſence, is a greater token for good, then that it ſhould be cruſhed by ſuch diſcouragements. 4. Albeit alſo ſuch as finde a diſtance, and are ſeeking to make it up, may poſſibly, for their further exerciſe, not ſeem to come ſpeed at firſt; yet that ſhould not weaken their hands: nor will they be accounted leſſe penitent, or be further from acceptance, that they are but purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and not enjoyers; for, approven repentance here is not to finde God, but to <hi>ſeek</hi> God, and theſe get the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.

                        <hi>Seek ye me, and ye ſhall live.</hi> 5. Albeit Satan lay many impediments in a penitents way; Sometime by aſſaulting him with fits of ſecurity; ſometime repreſenting God ſo unto him, as he dare not approach; ſometime ſuggeſting that there is no hope for him; and ſometime diſcouraging him, that his former endeavours ſeme to have been in vain: Yet this may reſolve the doubts of moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ſinners, that even they are commanded to come to God: and that by him, whoſe power may terrifie, and whoſe ſufficiency may encourage, and at whoſe command we may let down the net; Therefore is the exhortation thus preſſed, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto the houſe of Iſrael,</hi> (as bad as they are) <hi>ſeek ye me.</hi> See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.19. 6. A penitent ſeeker of God would not onely minde the command of God, but would eye the encouragement alſo, and joine the Goſpel with the Law, to quicken him in his duty; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there an encouagement ſub-joined, <hi>ſeek ye me, and ye ſhall live.</hi> 7. As all they who do not ſeek God, are but dead even while they ſeem to live in pleaſure, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. So to ſeek God is the undoubted way to attain a ſpiritual life, and to get a ſentence and principle of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, and to live comfortably in his favour: Yea it is the ready way to obtain outward proſperity, in ſo far as is for their good, and to have their lot, whatever it be, made comfortable: for, this promiſe, <hi>ye ſhall live,</hi> albeit it hold not out ſuch temporal favours to every penitent, as it doth to Iſrael; yet it holds out ſo much as is contained in the doctrine to every penitent. From <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. The right and acceptable way of ſeeking God is an old controverſie in the Church, and a controverſie which God onely by his word muſt reſolve and determine: Therefore doth he adde this direction how to ſeek him. 2. The following of idoles and their ſervice, and the worſhipping of God in and by them, will prove but a poor ſhift in trouble; and is a ſervice which he will not accept, nor approve of as right ſeeking of him: Therefore, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they might be ready (if they did any thing) upon ſuch an invitation, to run to the worſhip of the calves; The Lord expreſsly prohibites them, if they would approve themſelves as ſeekers of him: <hi>But ſeek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal; and paſſe not into Beerſheha.</hi> Theſe places have been often ſpoken of in <hi>Hoſea;</hi> onely <hi>Beerſheba</hi> is here

There is need of frequent up-ſtirrings and encouragements to ſet us on work, and keep us going in ſeeking God: Therefore muſt both the command and encouragement be repeated. 2.

                     <p>To help them to take with this exhortation, he laieth before them their guilt needing repentance and deſerving wrath. And as before it is inſinuated that they had ſinned againſt the firſt Table, in the matter or worſhip: So here their violation of the ſecond Table is laid to their charge, in that they turned the ſeats of juſtice into places of bitter and deadly injuſtice, and left no place for any righteouſneſs among them, but did tread it under foot. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Men will never be ſerious and ſincere in the matter of repentance and ſeeking of God, for any troubles that can come upon them, till firſt they be convinced of ſin and guilt: Therefore are they charged with guilt, to make the exhortation effectual. 2. The Lord abhorreth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality in mens taking with guilt. He will have them ſo take with one ſort of ſin, as they do not lightly paſſe over another; and ſo to ſee their ſins againſt the firſt Table, as they be humbled alſo for provocations againſt the ſecond: Therefore, after the challenge for their idolatry, he layeth before them their ſins in the matter of juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. 3. As the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice is a very profitable and pleaſant thing; So it is a bitter and deadly thing to pervert juſtice; And as it is bitter and intolerable to the innocent: So God will look upon it
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:114928:226"/>
as a bitter courſe which he cannot endure. Therefore doth he challenge them that they <hi>turn judgement to worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</hi> 4.

And it is conceived by many as a continued challenge, repeating from <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Ye leave off,</hi> or <hi>forſake him that maketh the ſeven ſtars</hi> &amp;c. But it runs as well with the tranſlation as a reſuming of the exhortation, which is the principal thing inſiſted on in this part of the chapter. And it is again preſſed, partly, from the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the power and providence of God, <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9. and partly, from the conſideration of their own ſins, and and of the judgements comming upon them, becauſe of ſin. In this <hi>v.</hi> the power and providence of God are commended as ſhining in natural things, and their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; 1. That he is the Creatour and Governour of the ſtars, and their influences, and of the ſeaſons cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: This is inſtanced in <hi>the ſeven ſtars,</hi> who do afford more warme influences, and <hi>Orion,</hi> which produceth boiſterous ſtormes. See <hi>Job.</hi> 9.9. 2 That he is the appointer and orderer of the viciſſitudes of day and night, whereby a cleare morning ſucceeds to darkneſſe like the
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:114928:226"/>
ſhadow of death; and again a darke night ſhuts up the clear day; or, (as this laſt part may be alſo underſtood) He can alter natures courſe, and darken the cleareſt day with thick clouds. 3. That he can raiſe vapours out of the ſea, and pour them out in rain upon the earth, or, can by inundations and deluges, let in the ſea upon the land. By all which it appeareth that he is Jehovah, the true God. Compare chap. 4.13. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as would ſeek God rightly, ought to know him, and ſtudy what he is; That ſo they may know him to be the true God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly above all idols; and that therefore his commands are not to be ſleighted, nor will he be pleaſed with outſide ſervice, and that all they who ſeek him ſincerely have cauſe to be encouraged in him. Therefore, doth he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe himſelfe, to preſſe them to ſeek him, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendes all in this, <hi>the Lord is his name.</hi> 2. The Lord is the Creatour and Supreme Governour of all the creatures in Heaven and Earth: And he is to be ſeen and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſuch, without reſting on theſe creatures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or aſcribing their courſes, motions, and influences to fate, or any ſecond cauſe: Therefore is it declared that <hi>he maketh the ſeven ſtars, and Orion</hi> &amp;c. 3. It is not enough to ſee God and his providence in the works of nature, or motions of ſecond cauſes; But we ought ſo to ſee him in them as may commend piety to our hearts, and preſſe us to it: Therefore doth the exhortation run, <hi>ſeek him that maketh the ſeven ſtars</hi> &amp;c. And particularly, firſt, it is an argument to ſeek him, that <hi>he maketh the ſeven ſtars and Orion.</hi> Whereby is held out. 1: That God is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and ought to be ſought unto and ſerved, who is not onely above men and creatures on earth, but his power is in the heavens. 2. He is able either to ruine or refreſh men by means and ſecond cauſes which are at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from them, even by the influences of the ſtars: and therefore he ought to be ſought unto. 3. The very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes and change of ſeaſons and weather, are Gods work wherein he is to be ſeen, and which ſhould invite us to ſeek him. Secondly, his <hi>turning the ſhadow of death into the morning, and making the day dark with clouds;</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that God is he who can change or ſettle conditions as he pleaſeth; He can turn adverſity into proſperity, and proſperity into adverſity, as he pleaſeth: And if he ſettle,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:114928:227"/>
none will ſhake, and if he ſhake none can eſtabliſh: And therefore the ſhort path to well-being, is to ſeek him. Thirdly, his <hi>calling for the waters of the ſea, and pouring them out upon the face of the earth,</hi> teacheth, that God hath ſhowres of comforts, and deluges of miſeries, to pour out as he pleaſeth. When they who ſeek him ſtand in need, he can bring abundance of comforts unto them in as ſtrange a way, as to <hi>call</hi> up ſea-waters into the aire, and purifie them, and pour them out upon the earth. And when ſinners neglect him, he can wonderfully plague them as if he made void his decree concerning the bounds of the ſea, and let it in upon the land.</p>

Wherein it is declared that he can employ contemptible and ſubdued people, and make them prevaile over the ſtrongeſt, and their ſtrong holds. This may be underſtood either generally, that the Lord doth this among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as he pleaſeth. Or more particularly, that he ſpeaks it with relation to them; and that either by way of threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that if they ſought not to him, but truſted in their ſtrength and forts, he could make moſt contemptible and weak means cruſh them and it. Or by way of promiſe, that if they would repent and ſeek him, he would ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them (though ſore broken) to recover and prevaile over their enemies. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The power and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, do ſhine not onely in the works of nature, and of natural ſecond cauſes, but alſo in over ruling the actions of men according to his pleaſure: and he (and not chance or fortune) is to be ſeen ſuprem in all of them; and a right ſight thereof will invite men to ſeek him who is ſupreme over them and their enterprizes: Therefore alſo is this held out as an argument preſſing them to ſeek him. 2. Mens ſtrength and valour, or their forts and ſtrong holds will prove but weak defences when God is angry, and is about to bring deſtruction; for, ſo is here
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:114928:227"/>
held forth. 3. God needs not any great or probable means, to oppoſe what men account their great ſtrength, or to bring it down; for, he <hi>ſtrengtheneth</hi> (or <hi>recreats</hi> and gives courage to) <hi>the ſpoiled againſt the ſtrong, ſo that the ſpoiled ſhall</hi> not onely hazard to go to the fields againſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but ſhall <hi>come againſt the fortreſſe.</hi>

And firſt, (which he ſpeaketh of them, as not worthy to be ſpoken unto) he challengeth; That in the gate they could not endure any rebuke, or upright ſpeaking: that is, their Judges eſpecially who ſat in the gate, were ſo wicked, and ſo incorrigible, that they could not endure any who oppoſed or reproved their unrighteous decrees, or who ſpake and pleaded for righteouſneſſe and equity. And they could not endure the Prophets who did pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly reprove their vices, and counſel them to do righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Adminiſtration of juſtice (being appointed for the genral good of a ſociety) ſhould be ſo managed, as Courts of judgement may be open and patent to all who are wronged. And Judges ſhould carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves openly and fairly in it. So much was ſignified by adminiſtration of juſtice of old, <hi>in the gate,</hi> where the meaneſt might have eaſie acceſſe, and the Judges deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in open view of all. 2.

It is the commendation of men in a declining time, that they are not drawen from their duty by the impetuous ſtreame of the time; and that they do in their ſtations, oppoſe others who do wrong, which is a meane to guard themſelves, when they are zealous againſt evils in others: for, here there are Prophets and others in their ſtations,
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:114928:228"/>
who <hi>rebuke</hi> and <hi>ſpeak uprightly,</hi> and that publickly <hi>in the gate.</hi> 4. Upright men, and ſuch as are faithful and free in an evil time, may expect not onely that they will not alwayes prevaile with theſe they deal with; but that they ſhall meet with contempt and hatred for their pains; for, ſuch was their lot here. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.21. 5. It is a great height of impiety, when men not onely do wrong, but cannot endure them who joyne not with them, or would reclaim them when they ſin with an high hand. This is an evil that, if it be not repented of and amended, will provoke God to take the reproofe in his own hand; As here he doth; and Rulers cannot be free of it, when they will not be medled with, nor endure counſel and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition from theſe who are warranted by God to offer it unto them. This is the ſumme of the challenge, <hi>They hate him who rebuketh in the gate</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, he challengeth them for cruel oppreſſion of the poor, and that (having taken all their ſilver from them) they did cauſe them bring their very meat and livelihood on their ſhoulders to them. And he declareth, that however they did this to inrich themſelves, and to make themſelves ſtately houſes and pleaſant vineyards, yet they ſhould not enjoy them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the poor is an hainous ſin before God, who is the author of juſtice, and Patron of the poor eſpecially. And it is a ſin, which when men are truly convinced of, they will finde themſelves in a woful condition, and in a condition calling aloud to repent; Therefore it is here challenged, and made uſe of to preſſe them to repent. 2. God doth take notice of the degrees of oppreſſion, and doth ponder all the cruelties in it, to lay them to their charge, who will not judge themſelves, and repent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for, he lateth to their charge, that they <hi>trod upon the
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:114928:228"/>
poor,</hi> or did ſo oppreſſe them as if they were but mire to be trod upon; and that they had a habite of this; their <hi>treading is upon the poor,</hi> as if they ſtepped not a ſtep, but upon oppreſſed ones. And he challengeth them that they deprived them of their very livelihood; <hi>Ye take from him burdens of wheat,</hi> which he had provided for his own main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. 3. Oppreſſion is ſo much the more odious, as the oppreſſor hath not a pretence of neceſſity for his courſe, but having enough, he muſt yet ruine others to make him live in more ſtate; for, he callengeth, hereby <hi>ye have built houſes of hewen ſtone,</hi> and <hi>planted pleſant vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards.</hi> 4. As all things in the world are but uncertain, even when men have them among their hands; and the uſe and enjoyment of what we have, is a new gift of God after he hath given it: So mens ill purchaſe, and raiſing of themſelves by cruel oppreſſion, is an unſure foundation, and may ſtrip men of faire poſſeſſions; for, <hi>ye have built houſes of hewen ſtone, but ye ſhall not dwell in them: ye have planted pleaſant vineyards, but ye ſhall not drink wine of them.</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, to confirme this challenge, and ſhew the equity of his ſentence; He declareth, that however they did palliat theſe their ſins, under the pretence of Law and right, yet he knew perfectly both the number and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their ſins. And to witneſſe this, he chalengeth them further concerning their oppreſſion, that beſide what was committed by great men in an extrajudical way, their very publick judicatories were corrupted, by afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the man who had a righteous cauſe, by taking a bribe, or ranſome (as the Original imports) to abſolve the wicked who ought to be condemned; and by depriving the poor of their right. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Albeit men be great palliaters and excuſers of their own way, that ſo they may deceive and ſilence others, and may delude and harden themſelves; Yet God doth perfectly know their
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:114928:229"/>
wayes in all the aggravations thereof; as here he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>For I know your tranſgreſſions.</hi> 2. As men who once corrupt their way within the viſible Church, will ſoon turn monſtrous; So it is an hainous provocation, when ſins are groſſe, and <hi>tranſgreſſions</hi> or <hi>rebellions;</hi> When theſe are not few, but multiplied and <hi>manifold;</hi> and when men are violent and impetuous in following thereof, and do break over all banks, and bear down all oppoſition in their way; Therefore are they called <hi>mighty,</hi> or <hi>ſtrong ſins.</hi> 3. Oppreſſion committed under the pretext of juſtice, is eſpecially marked by God as hateful, and as groſſe and violent iniquity; for, it is ſuppoſed that men who are employed to adminiſtrate juſtice do know their duty and danger better then others; and therefore it muſt be violent corruption in them that drives them to tranſgreſſe; and beſide, the proſtituting of juſtice (which is Gods ordinance) that it may be ſubſervient to mens corrupt ends, is abominable iniquity. Therefore doth he inſtance that general challenge, as being evident in the matter of juſtice. And he declareth it to be ſo hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that the actors thereof are not worthy ſo much as of a reproofe from God; And therefore, having ſpoken to them in the former part of the <hi>v.</hi> he ſpeaks this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar challenge of them, <hi>They afflict the juſt</hi> &amp;c. 4. As in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice may be ſeveral wayes committed; So all the kindes thereof are hateful to God. And whether men do afflict the innocent, or abſolve the guilty for a reward, or wrong a man in his right, becauſe he is poor, they will ſtill finde their courſe abhorred of God: So that men need not pleaſe themſelves that they are free of one kinde of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and injuſtice, if yet they be involved in another: Therefore doth he mark and challenge theſe ſeveral kindes of it, <hi>They afflict the juſt, they take a bribe, and they turn aſide the poor in the gate from their right.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15.</p>

<pb n="445" facs="tcp:114928:229"/>
them, nor ſpeak againſt that which they could not amend. Which yet doth not ſo much commend or juſtifie their ſilence in their ſtation, nor warrant others to follow it as a rule; as it declareth what was the great pride of that people, who ſhut all doors upon good counſels. But it ſeemeth rather to be a threatning becauſe of theſe their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, formerly challenged. And it may be conceived, either thus; That as they would not ſuffer any admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>v.</hi> 10. ſo the time ſhould come, wherein their evils and oppreſſions ſhould be ſo great, and their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours ſo cruel, that any, who had their wits about them, ſhould not dare to mutter. Or, (which ſeemeth to be the more ſimple interpretation) that judgements ſhould come, wherein the godly and prudent, wiſely conſidering the iniquity of the times procuring the ſame, ſhould ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and without murmuring, adore the juſtice of God, and ſhould have nothing to ſay or plead on their behalfe, why it ſhould not be ſo with them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Inſolent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent boldneſſe in ſinning, is juſtly puniſhed with ſuch cruel uſage from men, as that they dare not ſpeak nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan themſelves. And albeit it be mens great cruelty ſo to intreat an afflicted people; yet the afflicted are bound to ſee Gods juſtice therein. So much doth the firſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation hold forth. 2. As all men are bound reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to adore, and ſubmit to God in his judgements, and to ſilence all the ſwelling thoughts of their heart againſt his dealing, or at leaſt to ſmother them, when they cannot ſuppreſſe them, (for, ſo much doth this <hi>ſilence</hi> in general import. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39 9;) So it is a ſad caſe when the truly godly, who are cordial ſympathizers, and earneſt interceſſours in the ſtraits of a Nation, are ſtriken dumb in a day of calamity; and do ſee ſo much provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among a people, and ſo much incorrigibleneſſe under other means, that they have nothing to ſay wherefore God ſhould not take his rod in his hand; for, beſide the general duty, this is it which is here held forth in particular, as an addition to Iſraels calamity, that they ſhould be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and the godly ſhould have nothing to plead why it ſhould not be ſo, <hi>The prudent ſhall keep ſilence</hi> &amp;c. 3.

                     <p>The exhortation is the fourth time repeated, and is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explained and preſſed by propounding encouragements, <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. and partly preſſed from the calamities that were approaching, <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17. In this <hi>v.</hi> the exhortation is explained, that they ſhould ſo ſeek him, as to follow what is good, and to renounce evil. And unto this, the former promiſe of life is ſub-joined. To which is further added, by way of explication, that whereas they now onely preſumptuouſly dreamed and boaſted of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Gods preſence, they ſhould, upon their ſincere ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, finde it really true. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When the Lord is moſt ſharply reproving, and ſadly threatning a people, yet he would not have them thereby deterred from ſeeking to him; Therefore to prevent this miſtake, he repeats the exhortation after the former challenges and threatnings. 2. Men do need frequent up-ſtirring unto, and informations concerning the right way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſeeking of God, as being unwilling, and very ignorant and ready to run wrong, or pleaſe themſelves on ſleight grounds in that matter: Therefore is the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation again inculcate and explained. 3. Men in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, ſhould follow that which is really good, and not what ſeems to be ſo onely; And they who ſeek God ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, do not onely offer ſervice and homage to God, but are ſeeking their own reall good: Therefore is ſeeking of God explained to be <hi>ſeek good.</hi> 4. Albeit it be an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of mens enjoying reall good, when they ſincerely ſeek God; And albeit there be much good daily conferred on them who are ſeeking him; Yet the ſincere ſeeker of God will ſee his wants moſt, and be ſet on work to purſue after what is good; and theſe who are ſincerely purſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are accepted in Gods ſight. Therefore are true pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:114928:230"/>
deſcribed, that they <hi>ſeek good,</hi> rather then by their enjoyments. 5. Men muſt not lay their account to ſeek after good, retaining their former evils; But they who would approve themſelves, muſt abandon them, that they may enjoy good; Yea, their former fervour in following thereof, muſt be employed in ſeeking good, and muſt be a ſpur in their ſides, not to be remiſſe and coldrife in their duty; Therefore it is Subjoyned, <hi>ſeek good and not evil.</hi> 6. Let men reproach God and his waies as they pleaſe; yet it is a certain truth, that God delights to do good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his people, and that none ſhall ſeek him in vain; For, his word is again given, that ſeeking tends to this, <hi>that ye may live.</hi> Wherein not onely the certainty of their liveing is held forth, but his delight and deſire that they ſhould live; and therefore he exhorts them to ſeek, that ſo they may take the way to life, and get it, <hi>ſeek good that ye may live.</hi> ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.29, 30, 31, 32. 7. Albeit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſinners, ought to make uſe of the Law as well as the Goſpel; and albeit their diſcouragement and unbeliefe, being convinced, may for a time put them to ſome diligence and pains: Yet neither will they be able to perſevere in ſuch a courſe, nor will it worke an effectual and through change, unleſſe the Goſpel and encouragement by faith be made uſe of, and eyed likewiſe. Therefore, alſo doth he propound Goſpel encouragements and comforts, as a ſpecial means of making the exhortation effectual, <hi>ſeek good that ye may live</hi> &amp;c. 8 The Lords preſence in favour and mercy is the ſweet comfort and rich upmaking of a people, and the ſpecial and cheife cauſe of their happy life: And no wonder, he being the Lord, whoſe being is of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and needs nothing of them, and can give a being unto any encouragement, and by his word can create it of nothing, when they need it, and being the Lord of hoſts, whoſe power is able to protect them, and raiſe inſtuments and meanes of <hi>help unto them: Therefore it is added as their</hi> ſpecial encouragement, &amp; an explication of that promiſe of life, So the Lord, the Lord of hoſts ſhall be with you. 9. Albeit the members of a viſible Church, will not be put from a conceit of Gods favour and preſence with them, what ever their way be; Yet they are but <hi>deluded and do</hi> onely dreame of it, while they continue in ſin, and do not ſincerely <hi>ſeek him; for, it is imported</hi> they have ſpoken
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:114928:231"/>
much of his preſence, but groundleſly, ſo long as they did not <hi>ſeek good and not evil</hi> 10. It is a ſpecial encouragement to ſeek God ſincerely, that whatſoever men conceit of Gods favour and their own happineſſe, while yet they are in a wicked way, will prove all really true, if they will take the right way of ſeeking God: for, ſo is expreſly held out for their encouragement, <hi>ſeek good</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ſo the Lord, the God of hoſts ſhall be with you, as ye have ſpoken.</hi> 11. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men may boaſt of Gods favour and their hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſalvation, as their great happineſſe; yet they declare themſelves liars, and proclame their contempt thereof, when they will not ſo much as follow the ſure way to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that, which they pretend ſo much to eſteeme; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo doth he urge their preſumptuous deluſions againſt them, as pleading for what he preſſeth, that they ſhould take the right way to attain what they pretend to account ſo much of.</p>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>In this verſe the exhortation is yet further explained, that not onely in external practices they ſhould ſeek good and not evil; but that in their heart, they ſhould ſeriouſly and with affection and zeale, embrace the one and deteſt the other; And that they ſhould prove the ſinceritie here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of and of their turning to God, by the exerciſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice. Unto which an encouragement is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, that however <hi>Joſeph,</hi> or the ten tribes, whereof <hi>Ephraim</hi> was chief, were ſore cruſhed and but a remnant left of former judgement; Yet there is hope that God will ſhew mercy to them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1, Mans lazineſſe in ſeeking God before they be convinced, and their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements when they are convinced, are ordinarily ſo great, that they need much upſtirring and encouragement, Therefore are the exhortation and encouragement yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated and enlarged. 2. The Lord will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect mens external practice of good, when it may be their hearts abhore and loath it, and are bent on other courſes;
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:114928:231"/>
But he requireth cheifly that they be rooted in the love of good, and do zealouſly affect it. And when it is ſo, the Lord through Chriſt will paſſe over many failings in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; Therefore, it is further added to explaine and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large what is ſaid, v. 14. <hi>love the good;</hi> ſee Rom. 7.22, 23, 24, 25. 3. Mens affections toward good, muſt be evidenced by their cordial deteſtation of evil. Their hatred of evil, muſt kindle their affection to good, and their taſting of the ſweeteneſſe of what is good, ſhould again make them deteſt evil yet more: And where it is ſo, the Lord will have reſpect to the ſincerity of men under many failings, Therefore are they conjoyned, <hi>Hate the evil, and love the good.</hi> He wil not have them ſimply not doing evil, while it may be their heart is going a whoring after it, but will have them really deteſt it; and not onely ſo, but he will have their hatred thereof ſetting them an edge to what is good, and their loving of good cheriſhed thereby, ſee Rom. 12.9. 4. Albeit the following of good bring true advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto men, and evil courſes bring prejudice, and albeit this may be an encouragement and argument to prevaile with men: Yet it is not ſufficient that mens affections be ſet upon good, meerely becauſe of gain and advantage thereby, or that they loath evil only becauſe in ſome caſes and times, it may bring loſſe and detriment. But mens affections ſhould look upon courſes as good or evil in themſelves, and accordingly love and hate them, whatever may attend them; Therefore it is ſimply commanded, <hi>Hate the evil,</hi> becauſe it is evil, <hi>and love the good,</hi> becauſe it is good. 5. Such as are truely ſeeking God and turned unto him, ought to reſpect juſtice, and to prove their ſincerity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; Therefore it is ſubjoyned, <hi>and eſtabliſh judgement in the gate.</hi> Where to eſtabliſh it, is not onely to erect Courts for judgements, but to proſecute the courſe of juſtice firmly, not being ſhaken or diverted, by intreſt, paſſion, or reward. 6. Free grace and mercy in God, is the onely clame of all ſuch as are ſincere in ſeeking God, and are not puffed up with a conceit o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> their owne worth: And his grace and mercy (being the glorious and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent God) is ſo infinite, ſo free, and ſo tender, as may invite all to ſeek him, and to acquieſce in what his grace and mercy ſeeth fit to carve unto them; Therefore is this propounded as their encouragement, <hi>The Lord God of hoſts
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:114928:232"/>
will be gracious.</hi> 7. When a people do ſincerely ſeek God, he will reſpect all their afflictions, as arguments why he ſhould have mercy on them. And his former afflicting of them in juſt diſpleaſure, will not be an hinderance to his ſhewing mercy. Therefore it is added, <hi>he will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the remnant of Joſeph,</hi> that is, though he had been provoked to leave them but a remnant, yet he will now be gracious, yea ſo much the more, as they are but a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. 8. Albeit the Lord do allow encouragement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as ſincerely ſeek him; Yet he would not have them abſolutely expecting temporal deliverances, when provocations are come to a great height: And he ſeeth it meet to exerciſe them with incertainties, that they may be yet more deligent. Therefore is the promiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with <hi>it may be,</hi> to ſhew that as his graciouſneſſe appears in temporal deliverances, he would not have them peremptory about them, but to prove their real piety by ſubmiſſion in theſe things: And that he will hold out all their encouragements ſo, as may prevent ſecurity.

                     <p>To quicken them yet more unto his duty, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth that if they will not repent, (as there was no hope they would) he will not conteſt any longer, but that the ſentance is already paſſed, that he going through them with vengeance, will give matter of ſorrow and ſad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations to all perſons in all places. <hi>Whence learn.</hi> 1. Whatever encouragement God allow unto men upon their repentance, yet none ſhould ſcorn his threatnings, becauſe of his gracious offers: for when he enters in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe with a wicked people, he will either amend or end them thereby. And it proves too often true, that men are rather ripened for judgements, then reformed by the Lords dealing with them; Therefore he guards the former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:114928:232"/>
by this threatning, if they repent not, <hi>waling ſhall be in all ſtreets</hi> &amp;c: and he propounds it abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutly by way of concluded ſentence. <hi>Therefore the Lord ſaith thus</hi> &amp;c. to intimate, that however he exhorted and encouraged them, yet there was no hope that they ſhould hearken unto him. 2. Such as do provoke God, ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider how great and ſtrong a party he is; and for this end, they ſhould meditate upon him as he hath revealed himſelfe. And they who will not acknowledge his greatneſſe in his Law, propounding their duty, and prohibiting ſin, or in offering encouragements to divert them from their evil way, and vain deluding comforts; They, I ſay, may expect that he will make his greatneſſe conſpicuous in puniſhing of them; Therefore in pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this ſentence, he is declared to be <hi>the Lord, the God of hoſts: the Lord</hi> who <hi>ſaith thus,</hi> where he taketh unto himſelfe his ſeveral names, pointing out his eſſence, power, and authority and dominion. 3. When God is provoked by his people, eſpecially by their neglecting repentance and ſcorning his offers, he will not dwell in the midſt of them, nor protect them, but will turn their party, and run through their land with his judgements; for, where the former exhortations have not place, <hi>I will paſſe through thee, ſaith the Lord</hi> (See <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.12.) and this is the cauſe of all the wo that is here denounced againſt them. 4. When the Lord is provoked to appear in anger againſt them who will not repent, he will make all their joy and inſolent ſcorning of repentance, end in ſorrow; for, there ſhall be <hi>wailing, and they ſhall ſay, alas, alas.</hi> 5. God will make the ſorrow of a guilty people univerſal, both on perſons and in places; That ſo he may reach all who are guilty, and that they may be ſtripped of all comforts, who will not ſeek to him; for, this ſorrow ſhall be <hi>in all ſtreets, in all high-wayes,</hi> among <hi>the husbandmen,</hi> and <hi>in all vineyards.</hi> Neither City nor Country, ſhall be free of it, nor open fields and high-wayes, nor incloſed vineyards. 6. It is righteous with God to make the ſorrow of an impenitent people, ſingular; and unto ſuch trouble, inflicted by an angry God will produce ſorrow greater then can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; Therefore beſide theſe who are afflicted, <hi>ſuch as are skilful of lamentation</hi> (of whom ſee 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.17, 18. <hi>Math.</hi> 9.23.) ſhall be called to <hi>wailing;</hi>
                        <pb n="452" facs="tcp:114928:233"/>
Whereby the ſpirit of God doth not juſtifie the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mens having skill and faculty to put on ſuch affections, and their hireing them out for gain; But he intimateth that their ſorrow ſhould be ſo great, as to need help to expreſſe it. 7. We ought frequently to conſider that it is God with whom we have to do in threatnings and judgements; leſt forgetting that, we miſcarry under them: Therefore, again all is ſealed up with this, <hi>ſaith the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>Becauſe the Lord had to do with men of corrupt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, who would neither be allured with offers, not affrighted with threatnings, that ſo they might ſeek him; But ſtill foſtered themſelves in ſecurity, by reaſon of many falſe pretences and preſumptuous conceits: Therefore in the cloſe of this chapter, he refutes theſe their confidences, that ſo the threatnings might ſink down in their hearts, to move them to repent. And firſt, he deals with them who <hi>deſire the day of the Lord,</hi> that is, ſuch, who being Atheiſts and Epicures, did not acknowledge God or a providence, nor would believe any thing of approaching judgement; Or ſuch, who being preſumptuouſly ſecure of Gods favour and an intereſt in him, could not believe that any ſuch day would come as the Prophet threatned, or that it would be ſo dreadful to them, as the Prophets foretold. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in preſumptuous ſcorne they deſired once to ſee that day, wherewith they were ſo often threatned. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.15. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3, 4. Concerning theſe, the Lord declareth, that this diſpoſition
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:114928:233"/>
was an evidence of a plague upon them, and of more yet to come; and that they little conſidered what they were doing: for that day ſhould not onely come, but it ſhould be full of perplexities and miſeries, without any light or comfort, <hi>v.</hi> 18. And heaps of evils ſhould follow one after another, ſo that he who eſcaped one, ſhould fall in another, <hi>v.</hi> 19. yea certainly it ſhould be a time of great miſery, without any light of counſel or comfort, <hi>v.</hi> 20.</p>
                     <p>From, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. When the word is moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, and threatnings moſt terrible, there will ſtill ſome be found ſo atheiſtical as not to credite them at all, and ſo preſumptuous, as not to ſubmit to the verdict of the word, but they will comfort themſelves, expecting that God will do otherwiſe then it faith; for, ſo is here imported. 2. It is no wonder to ſee ſuch Atheiſts and preſumptuous ſinners, come to that height, as not onely to harbour ſuch thoughts in their own boſomes; but to pluck off any vaile of hypocriſie they had, and ſet down in the ſeat of the ſcornful and openly deride the word; for, ſo do they here, they <hi>deſire the day of the Lord,</hi> (or the day of vengeance, wherein he will prove himſelfe to be the Lord) that is, with inſolent and profane ſcorne, they deſire to ſee that day, and that the Prophets would make their words good, which they expect will never be. Albeit many who harbour ſuch thoughts would be unwilling it ſhould be known; Yet God is provoked to pluck off the mask, and bring them out: And where the word effectually preached, doth not prevaile, corruption will be irritate thereby, to vent it ſelfe more openly. 3. Such atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and preſumptuous diſpoſitions in men are an heavy plague of themſelves, and do portend more plagues, and that there is a plague and wo in all the calamities that come upon them. In theſe reſpects it is ſaid, <hi>Wo unto you that deſire the day of the Lord.</hi> 4. Epicures and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Atheiſts and Hypocrites, do little conſider what they are doing, or what is their danger, when they ſcorne threatnings and deſire to ſee them accompliſhed: And if their conſciences were put ſeriouſly to it, they would tell them it were ſo; Therefore doth he poſe them, <hi>to what end is it for you?</hi> Or, what can ye expect in ſuch a day? or what do ye gain by ſuch a ſcornful temper, that ye ſhould be ſo bent on it? Their conſciences (if awake) could
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:114928:234"/>
tell them that ſuch a day were rather to be prevented then deſired; and that they could reap nothing by ſuch atheiſtical ſcorn. For neither did it produce any preſent true good in them, nor would it hold away that day, but rather haſten it, and make it more bitter and grevious. And therefore they ought to conſider better and avoid it. 5. As even the cleanly trials of Gods people, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much humbling exerciſe through want of light or ſenſible comfort; that ſo they may be trials indeed, and may purge droſſe: And as judgements inflicted, upon a people for ſin, will be full of perplexity and diſcomfort, as being accompanied with reall deſertion, with guilt of conſcience, and other ſpiritual plagues: So in ſpecial, preſumptuous and ſecure Atheiſts may expect an hot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larme, and that calamities will be made dreadful to them; for, unto all, but eſpecially unto them, <hi>the day of the Lord is darkneſſe and not light,</hi> that is, full of miſery and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leaving them void of counſel and comfort. From, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. When God appears in anger againſt an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical and incorrigible people, they may expect to be involved in an heap of miſeries on all hands; and that not one, but many evils, either together, or following one after another, or both; Therefore it is reſembled to the condition of a man environed on all hands with <hi>lions, bears</hi> and <hi>ſerpents.</hi> 2. There is no ſhifting nor declining judgements when God ſends them: the ſinner that avoids one, may expect to meet with another, and he may expect a plague where he thinks to be moſt ſecure; for, it is <hi>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him, or went into the houſe, and leaned his hand on the wall</hi> (expecting to be upheld) <hi>and a ſerpent bit him,</hi> or, an unexpected ſtroak came upon him. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.17, 18. From <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>learn,</hi> 1. The ſadneſſe of a day of judgements and calamities, is not ſoon ſeen, nor laied to heart; and men ſhould ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider it before hand, that ſo they may be ſtirred up to prevent it, that they may not feele it: Therefore is it again inculcate and repeated, <hi>ſhall not the day of the Lord be darkneſſe, and not light?</hi> 2. The Lord needs no more to prove the truth of what his word ſaith, but mens own conſciences, which will be a witneſſe againſt their atheiſme and preſumption, however for preſent they lull them aſleep and ſeare them with an hot iron; Therefore
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:114928:234"/>
doth he put the matter to their own conſciences <hi>(ſhall not the day of the Lord be darkneſſe &amp;c?)</hi> as being witneſſes that might, and in due time would ſpeak for him. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the truly godly will have ſtill allowance of ſome light in trouble (though ſometime tentation hide it from them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10.) and may ſometime attain to ſome meaſure of their allowance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.4. and may certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that there will be a cleare and comfortable iſſue from their troubles, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.8. Yet it is terrible to think how dreadful a day of vengeance will be to the wicked, how grevious and perplexing their miſeries will be, and how deſtitude they will be either of preſent comfort, or of any hope of it for the future: Therefore is it added by way of explication, <hi>even very dark and no brightneſſe in it.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond carnal and preſumptuous confidence which the Lord refutes, is their hypocritical reſting upon their ceremonial obſervations, in keeping ſacred ſolemnities, offerings ſacrifices of all kindes, and uſing of ſongs and muſical Inſtruments in their Temples, all which they obſerved in imitation of Judah. And concerning theſe the Lord declareth, that however they pleaſed themſelves in them, and thought that he accepted thereof, and of themſelves for their ſervice ſake; Yet he abhorred them and could not endure them. The reaſons whereof are, firſt; That theſe performances were not of divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of their own inventions, and therefore all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long are called <hi>yours,</hi> or <hi>thine.</hi> The ſecond reaſon is more expreſsly held forth, <hi>v.</hi> 24. Which is not a threatning
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:114928:235"/>
that his righteous judgements inflicted for theſe ſins ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of him, ſhould carry all down before them like an impetuous ſtream; but an exhortation that they would ſtudy to abound in righteouſneſſe and juſtice, the want whereof was a cauſe, why no ſuch ceremonial ſervice could be reſpected. This reaſon pleads againſt the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance even of inſtitute ceremonial worſhip, when the worſhiper reſts upon it, not ſeeking to be reconciled to God through Chriſt, whom theſe ceremonies pointed at; nor proving the ſincerity of his Religion by the fruits of righteouſneſſe and new obedience. And in this reſpect we finde the ſame ſentence given out againſt the Jewiſh worſhip, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11, 12, 13, 14. and 66.3. <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.20. Much more might it be pleaded againſt them, who not onely rejected Gods inſtitution and command in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of their worſhip; but would not ſo much as ſtudy that behavour which God required in thoſe who worſhip him according to the Rule: and yet they reſted on it. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. This place holds out yet more parts (beſide what is ſpoken to chapter 4.4, 5.) of Gods approven Ceremonial ſervice, which Iſrael pretended to imitate; from which we may gather ſome inſtructions. And firſt; Their <hi>Feaſt Dayes,</hi> and <hi>Solemn Aſſemblies,</hi> or <hi>reſtraints</hi> from labour and other diſtractions, that they might attend ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip, do teach, 1. The people of God have mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of joy and feaſting allowed unto them in Chriſt; and they who embrace him ſhould labour to enjoy and poſſeſſe their allowance; Therefore had they <hi>Feaſts</hi> (the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof was Chriſt) which they obſerved. 2. The Lord requireth that beſide the worſhip performed to him ordinarily and daily, there be ſolemn publick worſhip in his Church; and that men performe the ſame on the times appointed by him for that end, and when his providence calleth them to any extraordinary duty; So much is poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out by their <hi>ſelemn aſſemblies.</hi> 3. Albeit the Lord doth not allow any to caſt off a calling under pretext of following his ſervice; yet he requireth that our follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our callings do not hinder his worſhip; and that when he calleth us to ſolemn worſhip, we lay aſide the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions of our employments; and what elſe may hinder the right performance thereof; for, their <hi>ſolemn aſſemblies,</hi> were <hi>reſtraints</hi> alſo, as the word imports. Which in
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:114928:235"/>
their feſtivites imported not onely reſtraint from their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary employments, but from their drouping diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alſo, that they might rejoyce in God. <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.9, 10. And in their ſolemn faſts, imported alſo their reſtraint from lawful delights, that they might waite upon the work to which they were called. 2. Secondly, their <hi>burnt-offerings</hi> (of which <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.) which were daily offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.38, 39. and which were joined with other ſacrifices; partly, in that they were daily offered, when other ſacrifices of praiſe, or for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins were offered, and before them: and partly, that their <hi>peace-offrings</hi> were laid upon them, on the Altar, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.5. and they were joyned with their offerings for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular guilt, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.7, 10. Theſe, I ſay, do teach, 1. Whatever men may pretend to in particular duties of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; yet all that will not availe, unleſſe, firſt, men make ſure the renovation of their nature, and that they have cloſed with Chriſt, for reconciliation of their perſons; So much was ſignified by <hi>the burnt-offering</hi> for all their ſins, and for the corruption of their nature, which they offered daily, and with other ſacrifices. 2. As praiſe for parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mercies will ſound well from them, who have aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of reconciliation through Chriſt; So no particular favour or mercy within time ſhould make us forget our miſery or need of Chriſt, or hinder us to make daily uſe of him: So much did the joyning of offerings of praiſe with <hi>the burnt-offerings,</hi> teach. 3. As men ought not to ſleep ſecurely under particular and daily contracted guiltineſſe, nor dreame that it is enough that their perſons are recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with God, unleſſe they alſo flee to Chriſt for expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their daily faults of ignorance and infirmity (for ſo under the Law, they had treſpaſſe-offerings and ſin-offerings, beſide their burnt-offerings) So men that make right uſe of Chriſt, to expiate particular guiltineſſe, will be led by their falling therein, to ſtudy yet more the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their nature and general pollution; and to flee to Chriſt, that the evidences of their reconciliation may be made clear unto them, after ſuch a cloud upon them; So much doth the joyning of offerings for particular ſins, with the burnt-offerings, teach. Thirdly, their <hi>meat-offerings</hi> (of which, <hi>Lev.</hi> 2.) and <hi>the peace-offerings of their fat beaſts,</hi> (of which <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.) which were ſeveral ſorts
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:114928:236"/>
of thank offerings, do teach, 1. Praiſe is to be made conſcience of, by all thoſe who live in viſible Covenant with God: and his mercies towards them are not to be buried in oblivion: So much did the appointing and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of theſe offerings teach, 2. The Lord is ſo gracious and condeſcending, that however he will not appove of ſleighters of his ſervice, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.14. Yet he will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect his ſervants according to the greatneſſe of their gift, but according to the ſincerity of the offerer; Therefore did he appoint both <hi>meat-offerings,</hi> and <hi>peace-offerings of beaſts,</hi> for praiſe; that ſuch as could not afford a beaſt to offer, might not be diſcouraged if they were willing, but might bring a little floure, and ſuch things as they had. This condeſcendence was obſerved alſo in other ſacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.7, 11. and 12.8, 3. Such as make conſcience to offer praiſe unto God, do reap much advantage unto themſelves; and Miniſters may look for ſweet dayes to themſelves, and for fair ſpiritual allowances and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when they miniſter unto a people whoſe hearts are in love with God, and taken up with his praiſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alſo was it called a <hi>meat-offering,</hi> becauſe the Prieſts got a ſhare of theſe offerings to eat, as both they and the people alſo did get a part of the <hi>peace-offering</hi> of beaſts. 4. Men are bound to offer praiſe to God, not onely for his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial favours and ſingular mercies, but even for common providences and favours, if it were of meat and drink: So much alſo was ſignified by their <hi>meat-offering,</hi> as ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that they acknowledged they had their meat of God. Albeit theſe mercies be common and ordinary, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore little thought of; yet they are in themſelves greater and more needful then many mercies, with the want or enjoyment whereof we are more affected: And conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being made of praiſe for theſe, it will prove a meane to draw down more ſpecial and ſenſible mercies. 5. Whatever the Lord accept of his poor and empty people, yet he requireth that we offer him the choice of what we have; and particularly, that we go not about praiſe with formal diſpoſitions: Therefore required <hi>he the fat</hi> in theſe ſacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 3.3. &amp;c. and therefore it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired they be <hi>fat beaſts.</hi> 6. Albeit praiſe be in it ſelfe an excellent performance, and men are ready to conceit of it, who attain to it: Yet Chriſt muſt be employed for
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:114928:236"/>
the acceptance of it, and the offerer muſt hide himſelfe and his ſervice under Chriſts righteouſneſſe, otherwiſe the beſt of it is an abomination before the Lord: So much is ſignified, not onely in that burnt-offerings were to be joined with this offering, as is before marked, but that all of them muſt be <hi>offerings,</hi> and laid upon the Altar, there to go up with acceptance. And Chriſt is the ſubſtance (as of the offering, ſo) of the Altar which ſanctifieth the gift, <hi>Math.</hi> 23.19. Fourthly, their <hi>ſongs</hi> and uſe of <hi>viols,</hi> do teach, 1. Singing of Pſalmes and ſpiritual ſongs is an ordinance of God, and a part of his ſervice, and meane of ſetting out his praiſe. 2. Praiſe is a duty, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance whereof we are eſpecially unfit; and a duty which requires the exciting of our ſelves and all the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our ſoul, and which needs ſpecial influence, that we may go rightly about it; for, ſo much was imported by the Ceremoial uſe of <hi>viols</hi> and other muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby they were excited and quickned to ſing, and whereby was ſignified the employing of all their ſtrength in that work.

Whatever pains men ſeeme to take in a way of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and whatever time they devote to it, or how ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſoever their performances ſeeme to be; yet it will be all to no purpoſe, where Gods warrant and inſtitution for theſe performances are wanting: Neither will God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that men dedicate and conſecrate a day to him as holy, when he hath not appointed it to be ſo in his word: nor will he accept of any ſervice, where a divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is wanting in whole or in part. Therefore doth he reject all theſe as their own, ſince their dayes were not the dayes appointed by him, and their ſervices were not performed in the right place, nor by the right Prieſts. 3. The Lords diſlike of will-worſhip, and the devices of men in the matter of Religion, is not onely a ſimple diſlike or not approving of it (though that be ſad enough, ſeeing it is his acceptance that makes our ſervice of any worth or uſe;) But he doth exceedingly abhort it, as a thing he cannot endure; that men ſhould be ſo preſumptuous as to take his roome to preſcribe the way of Religion, and to come before him with that which he hath not appointed; So much do all the expreſſions of the diſlike import, <hi>I

hate, I deſpiſe your feaſt dayes, I will not ſmell in your ſolemn aſſemblies</hi> (or, not accept or ſmell a ſavour of reſt in your ſacrifices offered at theſe times. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.18. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.40, 41.) <hi>I will not accept,</hi> or, <hi>regard offerings; take away thy ſongs, I will not hear thy viols.</hi> 4. Such as profeſſe that they have choſen the true God, and in teſtimony thereof, do offer external worſhip to him, ſhould prove the ſincerity thereof, and adorne their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by a righteous converſation, and by diſcretion and equity and juſtice in their dealing with men. And as will-worſhippers do make theſe (as well as others) commands of God of no effect by their traditions; So this their miſcarriage doth yet render their corrupting of Religion the more odious: Therefore doth he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate that they were wanting in the matter of <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſſe,</hi> which if he would not endure in Judah, who kept by the Rule in the matter of external worſhip; how much more intolerable was it in them who regarded not how they walked, and obtruded their own devices, as a ſatisfaction to him? 5. Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and judgement are then rightly performed, when men abound in the fruits thereof, like <hi>waters, and a mighty ſtreame,</hi> where there is much water; When they are firme and conſtant in them, like <hi>a ſtreame</hi> and river that keeps the channel; and when they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in zeal, bearing down all oppoſition, diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and tentation before it; like <hi>a mighty ſtreame,</hi> that runs and carries all that is in the way with it, and before it.</p>

For which he threatens, that they being heirs to their fathers guilt, and Imitaters thereof in their Idolatry, ſhould go into captivity in far countries. For clearing ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in this text, Conſider. 1. This not offering of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices unto God for the ſpace of forty yeares in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is not neceſſary ſo to be underſtood, as if (except what they did at mount-Sinai, when they entered in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant) ſacrifices were generally omitted in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as we finde Circumciſion was, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6, 7. But it may as well be underſtood thus; That though they did ſacrifice, and intended to offer it unto God; Yet ſince (beſide the Idolatry of the golden calfe, and ſuch like rites of their own deviſing, and their want of ſincerity, and true converſion and reconciliation unto God) they joyned groſſe Idolatry, &amp; worſhiping the of ſtars and hoſt of heaven with it, and their hearts and eyes were after theſe their Idols, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.15, 16, 24. Therefore the Lord expounds all their ſacrifices as not offered unto him, but to their Idols whom they reſpected ſo much, ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.22, 23. Deut. 32.16, 17. 2. This bearing of the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of their Moloch (as we are helped to read it from Act. 7.43. and not <hi>Siccuth your King</hi>) is to be underſtood thus, That though they carried about the Lords Tabernacle with them, as pretending to honour him, and that it was their glory to have him preſent among them; Yet they had alſo Images and repreſentations of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſe Idol Gods (as the text imports) which they carried about in ſome little tents like chappels. 3. As for theſe Idols, and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt this text and that place Act. 7.42, 43. (ſome whereof I remit to the doctrines) we may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. 1. That Moloch was an Idol of the Ammonites, as is frequently recorded in Scripture. 2. That which is called <hi>Chiun</hi> here, and <hi>Remphan</hi> Act. 7.43. is one and the ſame Idol, or ſuppoſed deitie; and is called <hi>Remphan,</hi> both by the Greek Interpreters of the old Teſtament, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Stephen,</hi> becauſe that name was better known to
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:114928:238"/>
the Egyptians where the Old Teſtament was tranſlated, and to the Jewes in theſe daies, then the other of <hi>Chiun.</hi> 3. Theſe ſuppoſed deities whom they acknowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe names, were nothing elſe but the ſtars or planets, as is expreſly cleared, Act. 7.42. where they are called <hi>the hoſt of heaven;</hi> and here, <hi>the ſtar of your God.</hi> An Idolatry to which they were much addicted afterward. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. &amp;c. It is not needful to determine what particular planets are ſignified by theſe names, though moſt probablie, by <hi>Moloch</hi> is meant the Sun, which (as the word ſignifies) is King of the planets and hath dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſublunary things; And by <hi>Chiun,</hi> or <hi>Remphan,</hi> Saturne. 4. They worſhiped theſe Idols not onely immediatly, but mediatly in and by Images repreſenting them, As is marked, Act. 7.43. <hi>Figures which ye made, to worſhip them,</hi> and here mention is made of their Images which it ſeemeth they carried about with them, and, <hi>the ſtar of your God,</hi> whereby I conceive is not onely ment, <hi>your God, the ſtar,</hi> by way of direction and ſcorn of their folly, in chooſing ſuch a deitie, but that either they made their Images in likeneſſe of a ſtar, or with the ſigne of a ſtar upon them, to teſtifie what they repreſented. Laſtly, it would be conſidered, that however this change ſhall be general; Yet it is not to be underſtood of every one in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, whereof many were godly, but of the body of the people. Doct. 1. Such as would profit by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and know the minde of God revealed therein, ſhould be converſant with all of it, whereby they will finde that in one place which is not to be found in another: As here we finde ſomewhat concerning Iſrael in the wilderneſſe, which is not ſo clearly in all the Hiſtory. 2. God will not account much ſervice to be offered unto him, which is pretended to be ſo: Nor will he accept of ſervice as done to him, when men do not offer themſelves to God with their ſervice, nor do keep cloſe by his way and rule. And ſuch is the ſervice that God gets even of many whom he chooſeth to be his peculiar people; for this cauſe doth the Lord ſay of Iſrael, that they offered not ſacrifices to him, as is before explained. 3. This carriage of the Lords people is yet the more hainous, when it is performed after glorious deliverances, and is of long continuance, and in the midſt of new exerciſes and gracious providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:114928:238"/>
for, that they neglected this <hi>in the wilderneſſe,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares,</hi> it doth not onely import that Iſrael was ſoone at theſe courſes which the preſent generation followed; But that it is grievous they ſhould do ſo in ſuch a time and place. 4. A preſent generation imitating the defections of their progenitours, have much old debt opon their head which will be laid upon their account; Therefore is this' laid to the preſent generation as their ſin, ſeeing they were one body with their progenitours, and did follow their courſes, <hi>Have ye offered unto me</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> 5. Let men do what they will ro ſtupifie their own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, yet they have not ſecurity of them, but when they leaſt expect, they will leap in their throat; And e're all be done, God will have the moſt obdured man pronounce his own ſentence with his own mouth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he (as often before) put their own conſciences to it, and poſe them, <hi>Have ye offered</hi> &amp;c? to intimate that they had no true peace of conſcience in the matter, and that their conſciences would at laſt turn their ſaddeſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 6. God will have no communion with Idols, nor will he approve or accept of even his own inſtitute worſhip, when men joyne Idolatry therewith; for, it was becauſe of their ſerving <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the reſt of their Idols, that God declareth their offerings were not offered to him. 7. The viſible Church may backſlide ſo far, as to be guilty of groſſeſt Idolatry; And God is provoked to give her up thereunto, when ſhe ſets up her own inventions in his worſhip; for, Iſrael <hi>carried the Tabernacle of Moloch, and Chiun</hi> &amp;c. And this is the fruit of their Idolatry in the matter of the golden calfe, as is cleared. Act. 7.40, 41, 42. 8. It is the great folly and madneſſe of men to think that a deitie is in their choice, to chooſe and make what they will, a God unto themſelves; Or to think to repreſent a deitie, by Images which are of their making; or to worſhip theſe Images, as in reality they do, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they pretend to the contrary; for, it was alſo their fault, that they had Images, <hi>the ſtar of your God, which ye made to your ſelves;</hi> And Act. 7.43. it is ſaid, <hi>figures which ye made, to worſhip them.</hi> 9. Idolatry, being continued in, will at laſt draw on exile and captivity; Therefore is the ſentence given out againſt the preſent generation, that ſince that courſe had gone ſuch a length, <hi>Therefore I
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:114928:239"/>
will cauſe you go into captivity beyond Damaſcus,</hi> And by this expreſſion, <hi>beyond Damaſcus,</hi> is imported, not onely that they ſhould be carried far away beyond that place, which <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 7.43. reſpecting the event, declareth how far it was; even ſo far beyond Damaſcus, that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Babylon alſo. But further the expreſſion may alſo import. 1. Whereas they thought much of the ſtroaks had been inflicted on them by the Syrians of Damaſcus, and that, belike ſome of them were carried into captivity by them; The Lord declareth, that they ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried further off then ever they were carried by the Syrians; And that their continued in provocations ſhould make them think little of what they had felt, in reſpect of what was to come upon them. 2. Whereas they might think ſtrange of that ſentence given out againſt the Syrians, and of their threatned captivity, chap. 1.5. The Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, that they ſhould be carried further off then the Syrians, and that the ſtroak to come on them, who were his people and yet proved incorrigible, ſhould be ſadder in that reſpect then his ſtroak on a pagan Nation. 3: Whereas they might look on the Kingdome of Syria and Damaſcus as a ſtrong bulwark betwixt them and any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter enemy on that quater, as being a potent Kingdome not eaſily to be ſubdued; The Lord declareth that this refuge ſhall faile them, and an enemy ſhould come further-off, who ſhould carry them beyond it. Doct. 10. Men will very readily ſleep ſecurely under ſaddeſt threatnings, unleſſe they conſider again and again that God is their party, and do ſeriouſly meditate upon his greatneſſe and power; Therefore are they again advertiſed, that this is ſaid by <hi>the Lord, whoſe name is the God of hoſts.</hi>

And by ſo doing the Lord would have it cleared that his ſervant was not partial in his doctrine, nor led by any private ſpleen againſt Iſrael; And he would let Iſrael ſee how little cauſe they had to be ſecure, ſeing Iudah is ſo dealt with alſo. In the firſt part of the chap. the Lord challengeth and denounceth a wo upon the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem and Samaria, (and eſpecially the great ones) for their prophane ſecurity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieing upon their ſtrength and eminency, <hi>v.</hi> 1.

                     <p>In this <hi>v.</hi> a wo is pronounced againſt the inhabitants of the chief Cities of both Judah and Iſrael, and eſpecially againſt the great ones there, becauſe they were ſtupidly ſecure, as truſting in their ſtrength by ſituation, and their own and the places eminency, theſe two places being the two chief places of both the Nations or Kingdomes, to which all Iſrael did reſort, as to the chief Cities of the Kingdomes and places of publick juſtice, and of publick worſhip alſo in Jeruſalem. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Albeit eaſe and a quiet ſettled condition be that which men love well, and do hunt after by all means, and take too well with when they enjoy it; Yet ofttimes ſuch a condition breeds ſo much preſumption and carnal ſecurity, that it brings a wo and curſe with it; for, <hi>wo to them that are at eaſe,</hi> or <hi>ſecure,</hi> as theſe at eaſe ordinarily are. 2. Such as ſeeme to cleave, or really do cleave to God and his way, better then others, may readily make a ſleeping pillow of that; and yet that doth not warrant them to be ſecure, but will rather put them in the front of thoſe that are under the wo, if they prove ſo: Therefore doth he begin with this, <hi>wo to them that are at eaſe in Zion,</hi> before <hi>Samaria.</hi> Where it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that they may be at eaſe, and that then they get the firſt of the wo. And he names <hi>Zion</hi> rather then <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe (among other reaſons) this mount was the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent part of their City, being the City of <hi>David,</hi> the man according to Gods heart, with whom the Covenant was made, and who herein was a type of Chriſt and the place whereunto <hi>David</hi> brought the Arke, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.12.

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The places here ſpoken of are known from Scripture what they were. For <hi>Calneh</hi> was an ancient City and Kingdome beſide Babylon, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Hemath,</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>math</hi> (called <hi>the great,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from a City of that name in the land of Iſrael, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 19.32, 35.) was a City and Kingdom on the North border of Iſrael, 1. <hi>Chorn.</hi> 13.5. 2. <hi>Chorn.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Numb.</hi> 34.7, 8, and here, <hi>v.</hi> 14. See 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 23.33. and 25.21. <hi>Gath of the Philiſtines</hi> was a known City nearer
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:114928:241"/>
to themſelves. But the ſenſe of the place is more difficult; for it is a general and ordinary rule, eſpecially in this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal language, that affirmative queſtions (ſuch as theſe are here) ſhould be reſolved in negative aſſertions: Thus the ſenſe of theſe queſtions in the end of the <hi>v.</hi> will be, that none of theſe Nations were better then their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, nor the extent of their border larger. And ſo the <hi>v.</hi> will contain a challenge of their ingratitude, who had abuſed ſuch ſingular favours by their ſecurity. But, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if we look on Iſraels land with all the priviledges they enjoyed in it, and in reſpect of Gods care and eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and its being a type of Heaven, it was juſtly called <hi>the pleaſant land, Dan.</hi> 8.9. and <hi>the glory of all lands, Ezek.</hi> 20.6.15. Yet it is not to be ſuppoſed but that other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions did parallel, yea and ſurpaſſe it, for ſtrength and greatneſſe of Cities, for pleaſure and fertilty of the ſoile, or for extent of bounds. And therefore I rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſcope of the <hi>v.</hi> on the contrary, thus; That it was in vain for them to truſt in their ſtrength and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>v.</hi> 1. conſidering that other Nations and Cities more flouriſhing and better then they, were now deſolate by ſome late ſtroak which it ſeemes was freſh in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, though not recorded elſewhere. And for further clearing of difficulties, it may be conſidered, 1. That theſe affirmative queſtions are not alwaies to be underſtood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativily, but ſometime do onely point out the certainty of an affirmative aſſertion, as 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.27. in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal it is, <hi>art thou a ſeer?</hi> which is as much as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he was one, and therefore ſhould carry himſelfe as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſuch a man in that time. Likewiſe <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. (where both the notes of interrogation here uſed, are) <hi>Is Ephraim a dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child?</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports an affectionate acknowledgement and reſentment that he was ſo. And ſo it may alſo import here, that they ſhould ſeriouſly conſider the greatneſſe of theſe Cities and Dominions which were now ruined, that they might ſee the folly of their vain gloriation and carnal ſecurity. 2. Albeit we do reſolve the queſtions negatively, <hi>they are not better then theſe Kingdomes</hi>  yet it will onely import this much here; that however of old theſe Cities and Countries were better then theſe of Iſrael and Judah; yet now, by reaſon of deſolation, they were nothing ſo: and
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:114928:241"/>
therefore did warn them not be carnally confident. 3. Whereas three places are here named and preferred to theſe Kingdomes, it is not ſo to be underſtood as if in every reſpect every one of them were better then they; for, though it be not to be doubted but ſome of theſe (and poſſibly both <hi>Caineh</hi> and <hi>Hemath</hi>) had both ſtronger Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, more fruitful ſoile and larger bounds then they; and though the land of the Philiſtines was very fruitful, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Sea, and belike they enjoyed a larger territory of old: Yet Iſraels dominion was larger then theirs, and therefore far larger then that of <hi>Gath,</hi> which was but one City: But the meaning ſeemeth to be; that whereas Judah and Iſrael boaſted of ſtrong Cities, pleaſant and large Territories; The Lord declareth, that if they view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe places well, they would finde they had ſurpaſſed them either in all, or ſome of theſe reſpects; And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, that <hi>Gath</hi> had been a ſtronger City then any of theirs. And for this cauſe I conceive it is that <hi>Gath</hi> is onely named of all the Cities of the Philiſtines, becauſe it onely before this time was become deſolate (belike ſince <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> brake down the wall thereof, with ſome other Cities, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6.) and never repaired; and therefore it is ſo oft omitted by the Prophets who lived after theſe times, when other Cities of the Philiſtines are ſpoken of. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Whatever outward favours the Church and people of God enjoy, wherein they truſt and reſt ſecurely becauſe thereof, yet the vanity of ſuch a dream may appear in that other Nations come no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing behind them in theſe things; for ſo is here held out, that theſe places had been better then what they enjoyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore it was their folly to reſt on theſe things. 2. As ſin doth bring deſolation on many a flouriſhing City and Country in all quarters; So the examples of Gods juſtice on heathen Nations ought to warn even Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their danger: Conſidering that his puniſhing of theſe who know not his revealed will, is an evidence that much more he will puniſh them; for, therefore are theſe examples produced, to warn Judah and Iſrael. And theſe are named to ſhew that in all places this his juſtice had ſhined, and it is like they had been wonderfully laid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate about that time. 3. That the people of God may prevent or cure ſecurity, and may get good of the warnings
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:114928:242"/>
that are given them; it is needful that they do not give way to ſupine negligence, but that they rouze up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to obſerve the paſſages of divine providence far and near in the world; and that they take notice of the power of divine juſtice againſt impenitent ſinners, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning flouriſhing Cities, and ſtrong and great Nations; that ſo they may not lean to ſmaller appearances, when yet they provoke God; for, to this end ſaith he, <hi>paſſe ye into Calneh, and ſee, and from thence go ye to Hemath</hi> &amp;c. Which is not to be underſtood ſo, as if they were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake any journey to theſe places, or that in their enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exile and wandering they ſhould ſee theſe ruins; But that as theſe things were true in themſelves, ſo they ſhould ſeriouſly obſerve the ſame in all the circumſtances, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute their own preſumption, and cure their ſecurity. The forme of ſpeech is like to that, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.10, 11.</p>

                     <p>The Lord proceedeth to hold forth further cauſes of that denounced, wo, by pointing out ſeveral effects and evidences of their ſecurity. The firſt is, That they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned all the threatnings of the Prophets concerning a day of vengeance; as not looking for it at all, or not ſo ſuddenly, or driving all thoughts of it out of their head. And upon this (which is a ſecond effect and evidence) they followed injuſtice and oppreſſion with great eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and haſted on the day which they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor deſire to think on. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As there is a day, which will be noiſome and evil to the guilty, haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the backe of ſecurity and ſin, (for, ſo is here imported, that there was <hi>the evil day,</hi> foretold to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) So it is the great ſin of a people, and an evidence of their deſperate ſecure condition, when they do provoke God, and yet do neither fear nor believe approaching judgement, nor will take with warnings of it; for, this people did draw theſe courſes near, which unavoidably drew on judgements, and yet when they were told of danger, <hi>they put far away the evil day,</hi> which may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they did not believe, or fear it at all, as chap.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:114928:242"/>
5.18. and 9.10. and in ſcorn told the Prophets it was prolonged, and therefore did fail, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 12.22. 2. As it is the ſin of men to look on judgements even but as a far off, when ſin is come to an height, and they are ſleeping ſecurely in it; So is it alſo their great ſin, and the dreame of ſecure ſinners, when they content themſelves that judgements are far off, and not neare, when yet that is but a poor comfort, ſeeing any thing that is meaſured by time will ſoon come about; for, ſo is further imported here, they <hi>put far away the evil day,</hi> when they looked on it (if it ſhould come) as not near at hand, and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with that. 3. It is yet further a poor ſhift of ſecure men, when they make not ſure their peace with God, nor deale with him to avert judgements; but all their care is, to put thoughts of judgement out of their minde, let God do as he pleaſeth; and ſo evil is upon them ere they know of it: for ſo much further may be imported here, that whether judgements were far off or near hand, they laboured to put all thoughts of it far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. 4. Men are but in a poor condition, when they do not order their way ſo as to abide and endure an evil day, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.14, 15, 16. and do not daily labour to anſwer that queſtion, <hi>what will ye do in a day of viſitation? Iſa.</hi> 10.3. But all their care is to avoid it on any termes; for, ſo much alſo doth this <hi>putting far away the the evil day</hi> import, that they had nothing to beare out in ſuch a day if it ſhould come; whereas the godly are made able to reſolve upon and ride out the ſaddeſt of ſtormes, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. 5. When men ſin, and yet caſt off all fear of judgements, it will ſoon harden them and make then very eager in their courſe; and that is a new judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them; for, upon the former followeth, they <hi>cauſe violence to come neare,</hi> and are eager upon it. 6. Whatever ground of confidence men may ſeeme to have againſt an evil day; yet it is an ill mark of it, when it makes them the bolder on ſin, which procureth the ſtroak, and makes it bitter and ſad: for, this is marked as one fault of their ſecure thoughts about an evil day, that this made them more bold to ſin, <hi>they put far away the evil day, and cauſe violence to come neare.</hi> 7. Oppreſſion and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not onely an hainous ſin, but a cleare evidence of ſecurity, of atheiſtical contempt of the word and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:114928:243"/>
thereof; for, upon their ſecurity, and <hi>putting far away the evil day,</hi> this ſin in particular followeth, <hi>they cauſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to come neare:</hi> So neare as they bring this, ſo far have they put away the other in their hearts. 8. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is yet the more hainous, when it is acted under colour of law and juſtice, by Superiour and inferiour Magiſtrates; for, it adds to it that it is <hi>the ſeat</hi> (or bench) <hi>of violence,</hi> and elſewhere <hi>the throne of iniquity, Pſal.</hi> 94.20.</p>

                     <p>A third effect and evidence of their ſecurity, is, their luxury and ſenſuality, in that they lived a merry life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtately beds and couches, abounding with ſuperfluity, whereon they lay and ſtretched themſelves, when they were full at their feaſts; they made themſelves good cheare, had much mirth and muſick at their feaſts, drank largely out of great bowls, and anointed their bodies (as the cuſtome then was at feaſts or in more cheerful times, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.46.) with the beſt ointments. All which is the more hateful, that (which is a fourth effect and evidence of their ſecurity) they little minded the affliction of their brethren, or of the body of the Church and Nation, who were in diſtreſſe up and down the country, while they lived at eaſe in the chief Cities. He calls them who were afflicted, <hi>Joſeph,</hi> either becauſe it was the ten Tribes who ſuffered chiefly at that time, with whom even they of Judah were bound to ſympathize; Or, becauſe he would put theſe great ones in minde, that their carriage was like the carriage of
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:114928:243"/>
                        <hi>Joſephs</hi> brethren toward him, who ſat down to eat bread, and little regarded the affliction of his ſoul when he was caſt into the pit, and ſold. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.24, 25. and 42.21. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Men do undeniably bewray their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure diſpoſitions and abuſe of eaſe, when all the uſe they make of it, is to pamper and ſatiat themſelves with beaſtly pleaſures, and they do live in riot and ſenſuality, omitting nothing that may make them compleat Epicures; for, ſo is it here laid to their charge, as a fruit of their being at eaſe, that they <hi>lie upon beds of ivory,</hi> and eat and drink well &amp;c. Not that it is ſimply unlawful for great men to lie better, and feed on better things then others; but that (beſide the unſeaſonablneſſe thereof, of which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) they exerciſed all their care about theſe things, were exceſſive and ſuperfluous in them, and reſted thereon and glutted themſelves therewith. And if this be a ſin in thoſe that are at eaſe; much more in them who are in diſtreſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.12, 13. 2. Men have need to watch over their wayes even in meaneſt things, and to take heed leſt in their very beds, houſhold furniture, meat and drink, and dreſſing of their bodies, and the like, they be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a wo upon themſelves; for, in all theſe the Lord hath a quarrel againſt theſe ſecure ſinners. 3. Miniſters lawfully may, yea and in duty ſhould be particular in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning ſins, and lay before men their failings in beds, table, apparrel <hi/> for, ſo doth <hi>Amos</hi> here in the Lords name. 4. As men may lead a merry life, who yet have no cauſe of joy: ſo however ſecure ſinners, who chuſe ſuch mirth for their portion, and ſhelter againſt all ſtormes, do keep themſelves throng with it, leſt an evil conſcience flee out upon them; yet all this their joy doth but adde fuel to the fire, and contribute to make the wo the ſadder; for, ſo much may we learn from their <hi>chaunting to the ſound of the viol</hi> (or joyning their voice with the inſtrument) <hi>and inventing inſtruments of muſick;</hi> whereby muſick is not condemned, but they are condemned who pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it, and fed their ſecurity thereby, little mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their duty, or that which would be matter of true peace and joy unto them. 5. It is an aggravation of the ſin of wicked men, when they abuſe the example of Saints to ſin; either when they ſtumble on their infirmities, or do pretend to imitate their good actions in their ill
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:114928:244"/>
courſes, and abuſe that which they enjoyed well; for, this adds to their ſin, that they alleadged they did this <hi>like David,</hi> who was a great lover and Maſter of muſick, but he ſpent all his care that way in ſetting forth Gods praiſe, whereas they onely made uſe of it for carnal pleaſure. 6. Afflictions are ſent upon ſome people, and not upon others, or on ſome part and perſons of a Nation, and not upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not onely for their own correcttion and exerciſe who are afflicted, but to try the ſympathie of others, and to ſee what uſe they will make of it; for, <hi>Joſephs affliction</hi> or <hi>the breach</hi> made upon him, tried theſe Grandees. 7. As much ſenſual pleaſure doth beſot men, and deprive them of all ſenſe of the afflictions of others, and ſympathie with them; (for, here the one followeth on the other) So whatever may be pleaded for the pomp and ſtate and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of great men; yet it cannot but be ſinful in a time of affliction, and when it deprives them of all ſympathie and fellow feeling, and they make themſelves a good life, when others are undone. For, it is the challenge, that they do all theſe things, <hi>but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joſeph.</hi>

The luxury of great and rich men doth import ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper among a people as will draw on ſpeedy captivity upon them; for, <hi>now captivity</hi> is to be the lot of all, as well as of them. 2. Such as are moſt ſecure when the Lord makes a breach by trouble, and do think themſelves fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from it, may taſte firſt of it; for, <hi>they ſhall go captive with the firſt that go captive,</hi> to wit, of the inhabitants of theſe Cities; for, otherwiſe the country was ſpoiled and many of them captivated before. Or, it may be read, <hi>they ſhall go captive in the head of them that go captive,</hi> that is, they
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:114928:244"/>
ſhall be ring-leaders, and noted and eminent ſufferers in this miſery, as before they were eminent in place, and chief in following ſinful pleaſures.

Luxury and wanton ſenſuality and ſuperfluity will be made to ceaſe; and if nothing elſe will do it, God can make captivity effect it: Therefore it is ſub-joined, <hi>and the banquet of them that ſtretched themſelves</hi> (or, <hi>abounded with ſuperfluities) ſhall be removed;</hi> The word rendered <hi>banquet,</hi> ſignifieth <hi>mourning,</hi> or, <hi>a mourning feaſt,</hi> as it is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.5. in the text and margent; to intimate that their feaſting ſhould in the iſſue prove ſad and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as their mourning feaſts were. 4. God abhorreth ſenſuality for this among other cauſes, that it exhauſteth men with providing needleſſe ſuperfluities, whereas na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is content with a little; and it miſpends their time, and makes them unable for a calling; for, ſo is held out here, they (as the word will beare) <hi>abounded with ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity</hi> in their banquets, and they did eat and drink, and then <hi>ſtretched themſelves</hi> on beds, when they were full, as being meet for no employment.</p>

the ſecure thoughts of ſinners, yet it is his irrevocable ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to puniſh theſe who continue impenitent in luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous courſes, and he is able to execute it: for, <hi>the Lord God hath ſworn by himſelf,</hi> or <hi>by his life,</hi> or <hi>ſoul,</hi> that he will do this.

As for that conference in the end of <hi>v.</hi> 10. it is by many underſtood thus; That when the Uncle ſhall know from him who goeth into burn the body, and bring out the bones, that no more are left alive, or that all the dead are now burnt; he ſhall enjoine him ſilence, and not to murmure againſt the juſt providence of God, ſeeing neither the dead nor themſelves had acknowledged or glorified him. But it ſeemeth more genuinly to point at this; That they two, when they are aſſured that there are no witneſſes of what they have done, ſhall aggree to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to keep ſilent what they had done, left they ſhould be ſequeſtrate, as being legally polluted by touching the dead, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.14. ſeeing in theſe extremities and confuſions they could not poſſibly obſerve theſe legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions. This is called <hi>a making mention of the name of the Lord,</hi> becauſe by obſerving theſe ordinances, they did acknowledge and glorifie him as he revealed himſelfe and enjoined to them. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Where God hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, mens eſcaping of one ſtroak will not ſecure
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:114928:246"/>
them againſt another; for, <hi>if there remaine ten men in one houſe, they ſhall die.</hi> Whether we take <hi>ten men</hi> for few, or (which is more likely) for many in a great family; yet they <hi>remain</hi> after former calamities that have ſwept away others, and now they ſhall die. 2. Beſide the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing of a State and Nation, and theſe who fall in ſuch a time by the ſword and captivity, God is provoked alſo in a time of wrath, to purſue particular families and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with peſtilence and other plagues: Yea it is not ſtrange when the Lord breaks a Nation by captivity or ſubjection, to ſee that preſent generation poſted away with mortality and death; for, after the former ſtroaks, <hi>v.</hi> 7.8. it followeth, <hi>if ten men remain in one houſe, they ſhall die:</hi> 3. It is an addition to the calamity of ſad times, when men are not onely cut off, but want the honour and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of ordinary burial; for, <hi>a mans uncle ſhall take him up, and he that burneth him to bring out the bones out of the houſe.</hi> Albeit among the Jewes, they burnt odours at the funerals of ſome of their Kings, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.14, and 21.19. yet in ordinary they buried the dead bodies, and onely in great extremities burnt the bodies and buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bones, as 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 31.12, 13. And therefore it adds to the affliction, that there are but two here to bury many, and that they muſt burn them. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.3. 4. Whatever may be the Lords condeſcendence in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; Yet it is a great addition to the calamities of a time, when the obſervation of any ordinances enjoined by God, are interrupted thereby. For, albeit in many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities (and belike in ſuch as this was) the Lord did diſpenſe with Ceremonial obſervations, yet it was in it ſelfe an affliction that they <hi>might not make mention of the name of the Lord.</hi> Compare <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9.3. 5. The Lords appointing of ordinances unto a people, is that whereby he reveals himſelfe unto them, and in the obſervance whereof he will be acknowlegded and honoured by them; and it is the honouring of him which men ſhould chiefly minde in theſe obſervances; Therefore, as God ſetting up ordinances is his recording of his Name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. ſo the right performance and obſerving of theſe ordinances, is declared to be <hi>a making mention,</hi> or <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the name of the Lord.</hi> 6. Whatever clearneſſe men themſelves have in the matter of their liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:114928:246"/>
religions obſervations; Yet eſpecial care ſhould be had that they give no ſcandal in the uſe of their liberty. So much ſeemeth to be imported in the conference, and that they ſhould keep the matter quiet, knowing that ſome were ſo ſcrupulous as not to digeſt this even in greateſt extremities.</p>

in a <hi>thing of naught;</hi> or that which is nothing. 4. Mens exalting themſelves in what they enjoy, and aſcribing the glory of it and the purchaſe thereof to themſelves, is a cleare evidence of carnal gloriation, and that what they glory in will prove naught; for, this was an evidence thereof, they <hi>rejoyce in a thing of naught, who ſay, Have we not taken to us horns by our own ſtrength?</hi> as quickening up themſelves and others to conſider this, as if they were not yet high enough in their own or others thoughts. See <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30, 31. and 5.19, 20. 5.

God is an impartial avenger of ſin in one and other; and when a diſeaſe is univerſal, he can make ſcourges go through a land and all the corners thereof: And as carnal gloriation will not ceaſe, ſo long as a people have any thing to look to in any corner; So God will ſtrip ſinners of any ſuch refuge; for, ſo much is imported in this, they ſhall <hi>afflict you from the entering in of Hemath, unto the river of the wilderneſſe,</hi> whereby is held out, that God would neither ſpare Iſrael nor Judah, but would ſend an univerſal ſtroak to refute their folly in every corner.</p>

                     <p>The Lord being to declare that his long-ſuffering and patience toward that people, was at an end; He doth firſt hold forth how and in what meaſure it had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to them, by two types and viſions. The firſt whereof (in theſe verſes) is of graſhoppers created by God to conſume their fruits, which having conſumed much, they are (upon the interceſſion of <hi>Amos,</hi> pleading from <hi>Jacobs</hi> irrecoverable condition) recalled from the utter conſuming of all. For clearing of this, conſider, 1. This being but a viſion, it is not needful to underſtand
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:114928:249"/>
theſe <hi>graſhoppers</hi> literally, or onely of theſe or the like creatures ſent among them, and cauſing famine, of which chap. 4.9. But generally they ſignifie all the leſſer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions (by incurſions and invaſions from enemies, by drought, inſects, or the like) whereby they were afflicted, and by which, and his ſending them in a more moderate and gentle way, God did excite them to repentance. 2. As for the time of this viſion, being <hi>the beginning of the ſhooting up of the latter growth, after the Kings mowings,</hi> it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be underſtood not ſo much of their cutting the firſt growth of the rank corn, that ſo it might ſtand and ripen the better; as that the firſt growth of their graſſe was cut down for the Kings uſe, to maintain his war-horſes, and the latter growth came to the people for their private uſe. And this circumſtance of the viſion is not neceſſarily to be interpreted of their condition after their defection from the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> that their former flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was become but like a latter growth, oft cut down: But it ſeemeth rather to ſignifie that this rod did afflict chiefly onely the body of the people, their Kings being (as the type imports) furniſhed, and their ſtate yet ſtanding. 3. This interceſſion of the Prophet, albeit it hold forth in particular his tenderneſſe and ſympathie with that people; yet it points out alſo what was the practice of all the godly in that time. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. When the Lord is about to ſtrik his people in greateſt extremity, it is their duty to be convinced, and acknowledge that mercy and long-ſuffering hath been much manifeſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, before it come to that; for, ſo much doth the ſcope of this and the following type and viſion, premitted to the third, import: for by the two firſt he clears what his long-ſuffering had been, before the final ſentence come forth. 2. Such is our ſtupidity, and little obſerving of Gods dealing, that when it is moſt obvious and viſible, yet it muſt be much and divers wayes inculcate; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the afflictions that had come upon them, might be ſenſibly felt; Yet it muſt not onely be told they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, but it muſt be held out in a ſenſible type, and they excited twice to remark it, <hi>Behold, lo;</hi> and all this eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially is done, to let them ſee Gods hand in theſe lots, that ſo they might make uſe of them. 3. It is not inconſiſtent with the Lords mercy and long-ſuffering toward a ſinning
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:114928:249"/>
people, that he ſtrikes them in ſome meaſure: But when he doth ſmite in meaſure and not procceed to extremity, even that ſhould ſerve to magnifie his mercy and long-ſuffering, and to invite them to repentance, that they may reap more fruits of mercy; for, in this viſion, wherein he holds out his long-ſuffering, it is declared he did ſmite them, but ſo as might rather allure them to come to him, then conſume them. 4. Trouble is of Gods creating and forming, and he is to be looked on as the author thereof; and before a needful affliction be wanting, God will create or forme it out of nothing, or what is unlikely to produce ſuch a trial: for, <hi>the Lord God ſhewed to me, and behold, he formed graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers.</hi> 5. Weak means and ſcourges in Gods hand will ſerve his turn, to afflict in what meaſure he pleaſeth; Therefore are theſe afflictions compared to <hi>graſhoppers,</hi> or the like little creatures, and yet they did eat up, and put the ſenſible Prophet to prayer. 6. It ſhould be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as ſpecial mercy, when God doth ſpare any thing, when he inflicts ſtroaks on a people for ſin: And in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, albeit ſtroaks on particular perſons may be very ſad; yet they ſhould not be accounted intolerable, ſo long as the publick intereſt and a ſtate ſtands; for, ſo much may be ſignified by the graſhoppers coming not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the latter growth after the Kings mowings,</hi> as is before explained. 7. It is no ſtrange thing, that when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts any calamities, they do conſume much before a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be ſtirred up to make any uſe of them; for, ſo much is imported in the viſion, <hi>they made an end of eating the graſſe of the land,</hi> before the Prophets interceſſion. 8. Albeit ofttimes few of theſe who are ſmitten and eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in judgements, will be ſenſible or ſeek to God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; yet the truly godly both ſhould and will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God in times of publick calamities; for, ſo much doth <hi>Amos</hi> practice teach. 9. Such as would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede acceptably with God, in times of calamities, ſhould be moſt affected with the ſenſe of ſin, and a deſire to have it removed; Therefore doth <hi>Amos</hi> begin, <hi>O Lord God forgive, I beſeech thee,</hi> as expecting a good iſſue from the trouble, in the pardon of their ſin. 10. Such as are truly convinced of, and humbled under the ſenſe of ſin, will be driven to ſeek for a free pardon, as their onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge; and will be far from thoughts of their own deſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vings,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:114928:250"/>
or of their ability to rid themſelves of that burden: for, ſuch is <hi>Amos</hi> requeſt, <hi>forgive I beſeech thee.</hi> 11. Trouble will ſoon exhauſt and bring a people ſo low, as there will be no viſible effectual mean of their reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were they never ſo potent before; for, ſo much is imported in that queſtion, <hi>by whom ſhall Jacob ariſe?</hi> that they were fallen, and neither could they raiſe themſelves, nor were there any other to help them. 12. When the Lord brings a Church ſo low, and they are ſenſible of their ſin; ſuch a condition calls on them who are ſenſible to betake themſelves to God, as <hi>Amos</hi> doth here; and they are warranted to cleave to a Covenant intereſt (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> with whom the Covenant was made or renewed) to plead in faith againſt the utter ruine of a Church, and her falling without recovery (for, the queſtion laieth this as a principle, that <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,</hi> and upon that he pleads againſt their hopleſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) and they are warranted to make uſe of their own weak and low condition, as an argument of pity; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſub-joined, <hi>for he is ſmall.</hi> 13.

Whatever be the carriage of men under calamities; Yet it is Gods mercy and gracious condeſcendence that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be magnified in any moderation or favour they meet with; for, <hi>The Lord repented for this,</hi> or <hi>of this</hi> &amp;c. It was his gracious condeſcending to change his dealing (as men do, when they repent) that produced this favourable ſentence.</p>

                        <pb n="485" facs="tcp:114928:250"/>The ſecond type and viſion pointing out Gods long-ſuffering, is of fire devouring the great deep (or drying up the ſprings which come from it) and conſuming a part of the land; the progreſſe whereof is ſtopped upon the interceſſion of <hi>Amos,</hi> as the former was. This alſo being a type repreſented in a viſion, needs not to be underſtood literally of fire or drought, whereby ſome parts of that Kingdome were afflicted. chap. 4.7.8.9. but it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to point out other ſadder calamities, which like fire threatned to devour the whole Kingdome (which may be here ſignified by <hi>the great deep,</hi> or a confluence of waters; as uſually great Nations are ſignified by <hi>waters, Rev.</hi> 17.1.15.) and did conſume it in part, when their power was broken and weakned, their men killed, and the ſword, famine, and peſtilence, ſucceeding one another, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, had almoſt ruined them. And particularly, it ſeemeth to relate to the ſtroaks inflicted by <hi>Hazael</hi> and his ſon, which had undone them, if the Lord had not raiſed up <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſecond to interpoſe, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 14.23,—27: and it may be alſo to the ſtroaks inflicted by the Aſſyrians before their final overthrow. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Leſſer corrections, and moderation and favour ſhewed in them, are ofttimes ſo abuſed, as draweth on new and ſadder ſtroaks; for, this followed after the former, when they had made no uſe of them, nor of their deliverance from them. 2. Such as will contend and ſtrive with God, and will not be bettered by his dealing, do provoke him to ſtrive with them yet more; and he hath ſtill more and ſadder ſtroaks, and inſtruments to inflict them, and power to make them effectual: for, he <hi>called</hi> (to his fitted inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) <hi>to contend</hi> againſt their ſtubbornneſſe by a new judgement of <hi>fire, and it devoured.</hi> By all which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelf to be <hi>the Lord God,</hi> as here he is twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. 3. The wrath of God purſuing an inpenitent people, is ſo violent and irreſiſtible as no indeavours of men can ſtand in its way, or ſtop the courſe thereof; Therefore it is compared <hi>to fire, devouring the great deep, and eating up a part,</hi> and ready to devour all, if God had not recalled it. 4. It is the duty of Gods people not to be weary of prayer and interceſſion in times of calamitiy, even albeit they ſhould increaſe, and a people grow ſtill worſe; for, <hi>Amos</hi> intercedes again upon this new occaſion,
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:114928:251"/>
though greater, and though the people were ſo much the more hardened, by their abuſe of Gods former dealing. 5. Albeit Gods faithful ſervants be ofttimes ill-beloved and hated by a wicked people; yet they are indeed their beſt friends, and ſpecial means, by their interceſſion, of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down any bleſſings which they enjoy; for, ſo did <hi>Amos</hi> prove to Iſrael, however they could not endure him. 6. The ſame arguments for coming ſpeed in prayer, muſt not be caſt away, even when a people have abuſed Gods accepting of them; but may yet be pleaded before him in new ſtraits; for, albeit the people made ill uſe of Gods favouring them in mercy, upon the grounds of <hi>Amos</hi> plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet he reneweth the ſame ſure in this new difficulty; onely in place of pardon and <hi>forgiving,</hi> he pleads that God would <hi>ceaſe,</hi> or forbeare to ſtrike further and conſume them by it; as being a viſible effect of pardon, which he deſires may be manifeſted: or as pointing out what it is to grant a National pardon to the body of a people; to wit, That the Lord would ſo far paſſe over their provocations, as not to deſtroy them from being a Church and Nation, though by peece-meal he cut off all the particular offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were they never ſo many, yea and puniſh them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for their ſins. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. 7. The Lords compaſſion is not ſo exhauſted, by letting forth it ſelfe in former exigents, nor yet by a peoples a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing the effects thereof; but he hath ſtill bowels of mercy ready upon prayers and interceſſions, to reſpect them: and it is not once but often that he moderates the afflictions of his people, before he utterly conſume them. For, upon this ſecond interceſſion for this ſtubborn people, <hi>Amos</hi> finds the ſame mercy in God, and gets the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that formerly. And albeit <hi>Amos</hi> was an eminent Prophet, yet he was a man ſubject to like paſſions, and may be an encouragement to others, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.17.</p>

                     <p>The ſcope of this third type and viſion, of <hi>the Lords ſtanding upon a wall made by a plumb-line</hi> &amp;c. is to ſhew, that the Lord will not deale ſo favourably with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as formerly. But as he had (like a Maſter builder building a ſtraight wall by a plumb-line) erected them into a Nation and orderly ſtate, and had given them an excellent rule and line of lawes, whereby they ought to have ſquared their actions; So ſince they were ſo far de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and were neither excited by lighter rods, nor drawen to repentance by heavier judgements, nor, wrought upon by his favours, He will not any longer ſpare them, nor hold off the extremity of deſolation and ruine from coming upon the Nation. But as a builder doth exactly try his work by his plumb-line, to caſt down what is not regular; ſo he will not look upon their ſinful courſes any longer with an eye of mercy, and pity, and long-ſuffering, but according to the ſtrict rule of juſtice: and he will exactly try how they have obſerved the Law in worſhip and manners, and will accordingly recompence, and not ſpare. And ſo this relates to what was execute by <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneſer.</hi> We have the ſame ſimilitude made uſe of much to this purpoſe, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 21.13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 2.8. and ſomewhat like it is ſpoken of <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.27. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is our duty to be attentive to what God reveals of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and of his minde, as being well worth the marking; and we have need to be excited to conſider it, even when it moſt nearly concerns us; Therefore is <hi>Amos</hi> quickned to conſider this type, by a queſtion, <hi>Amos, what feeſt thou?</hi> 2. When men are moſt attentive in conſidering, and do ſee moſt of what God manifeſts, yet they will not profit as becomes without Gods help, and unleſſe he explain his own minde from ſtep to ſtep; for, though <hi>Amos</hi> ſee the type, and give an account what it is, yet he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:114928:252"/>
the ſignification thereof, till God reveal in it to him. 3. When extreame judgements are neareſt approaching, ordinarily they are little diſcerned by them who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; for, ſo much may be imported in this, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Amos</hi> preſently underſtood the former types, yet he cannot underſtand this (pointing out the utter deſolation) though he ſee it, till God expound it. 4. A people who have formerly reaped the fruits of Gods long-ſuffering, even once and again, and after they have abuſed them, are not to expect that he will ſpare them, when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, and make no uſe of his goodneſſe; for after his former long ſuffering held forth in the former viſions, it comes now to this, <hi>I will not again paſſe by them any more,</hi> to wit, to deale moderately, and paſſe over their provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and ſpare them, or but lightly touch them as in paſſing, as he had done formerly. So the phraſe <hi>to paſſe by</hi> imports. See <hi>Mic.</hi> 7.18. 5. God needs no more at any time to ruine a people, but exactly conſider their ſins according to the Law, and puniſh them accordingly; and he will do ſo to all ſuch as make no uſe of Chriſt, but continue in ſin, and turn the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; for, ſo much is ſignified by <hi>ſetting a plumb-line in the midſt of Iſrael,</hi> as is before explained. 6. No priviledge or pretence of intereſt in God will ſecure impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, nor availe them to prevent even utter deſolation; Therefore doth he give them their title, <hi>my people Iſrael,</hi> in the very ſentence, to ſhew that this ſhould availe them nothing to hold it off. 7. When God reckons with his people, it will be a ſad account that he hath taken much pains upon them, and furniſhed them with notable means of doing well, and yet they have degenerate; So much is ſignified in that they were ſometime <hi>a wall made by a plumb-line,</hi> whom now he tries by a <hi>plumb-line.</hi> See <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. 8. It is a ſad evidence that judgements do tend to utter ruine, when prayer is reſtrained under them; So much ſeemeth to be ſignified in that <hi>Amos</hi> intercedes not here as formerly. And we finde it foretold that during the captivity of Babylon, prayer ſhould be reſtrained, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.23. And it is regrated that it was ſo, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.13.</p>

                     <p>This ſentence of their utter ruine, is further enlarged and explained: and it is declared, that eſpecially he will deſtroy their idolatry, and lay the places thereof deſolate; and that he will cut off the houſe of their King, and ſo pull away the two pillars upon which their ſtate leaned. This ſtroak on <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſeconds family was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as we finde, 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 15.8, 9, 10. after which the Kingdome decayed daily, and came to ruine ſpeedily. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Idolatry and a falſe religion is one prop of a ſtate which will ſooneſt faile it of any, and a ſin which God will leaſt ſpare in his people, of any courſe they take; for, ſo did Iſrael finde in the matter of what they accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their <hi>Sanctuaries,</hi> and their <hi>high places.</hi> 2. The Lord is ſo provoked againſt idolatry and a falſe religion among his people, that he will be ſatisfied with no leſſe then the utter overthrow thereof, and the deſolation, of the places where it is practiſed, if no other courſe will draw men from it; Therefore he threatens that their high <hi>places and Sanctuaries ſhall be deſolate and laid waſte.</hi> 3. The moſt ſpecious pretences of imitating and reſpecting godly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitours, in idolatrous courſes, will not juſtifie them, were they never ſo many; But that abuſe and pretence will adde to the controverſie; Therefore are they called <hi>the high places of Iſaac,</hi> (who worſhipped God publickly in ſeveral places of that land, chiefly at Beerſheba, as is mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on chap. 5.5.) <hi>and the ſanctuaries of Iſrael,</hi> who met with God, and worſhipped him in ſeveral places, eſpecially at Bethel. And by this is declared, that their pretence of imitating them in chooſing theſe places, ſhould not hold off the ſtroak, but rather help it on. 4. Royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the command of Rulers can as little juſtifie idolatry, as the pretence of the example of Progenitours; But Rulers do thereby rather draw violent deſtruction upon themſelves and their families, which God is able to
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:114928:253"/>
inflict when he pleaſeth: for, ſaith he, <hi>I will riſe againſt the houſe of Jeroboam with the ſword.</hi> 5. The violent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that come even upon wicked Rulers, are tokens of wrath, and a meane to draw it on upon a ſinful land; for, this againſt the houſe of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> is brought in as helping on that ſad ſtroak upon the whole Nation. <hi>v.</hi> 8.</p>

                     <p>Followeth, to the end of the chapter, the prophets trials from the falſe prieſts at Bethel, with his carriage in relation thereunto. This prieſt doth, Firſt (in theſe verſes) accuſe him to the King. Wherein, 1. He chargeth him with treaſon and open rebellion, and that he excited the people againſt authority by his doctrine againſt him. 2. He declareth that <hi>the land cannot bear all his words,</hi> whereby may be ſignified, that upon his doctrine, the land is like to be ſhaken with commotions, tumults and conſpiracies; Either the ſubjects being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with his doctrine will ſide with him, and riſe up againſt authority, or (which is more likely to be the ſenſe) the people cannot endure him and his doctrine, and are but waiting for the Kings decree againſt him, that they may execute it; or are ready to do it of their own head in a tumultuous way, if he will not appeare. And ſo he would inſinuate to the King, that it was a way to loſe the hearts of his ſubjects, if he did tolerate ſuch a man ſo odious to him. 3. To make good this his charge and aſſertion, he repeats ſome of <hi>Amos</hi> doctrine to the King, but unfaithfully and not fully. Doct. 1. Such as are, and reſolve to be faithful meſſengers and ſervants to God, in corrupt and declining times, ought to lay
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:114928:253"/>
their account for perſecution; for, ſo much doth <hi>Amos</hi> lot warn us of. 2. As falſe teachers prove readily moſt cruel perſecuters of faithful Miniſters, becauſe of their own intereſts, that are like to ſuffer prejudice; So this courſe is more horrid in them then any others; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it chiefly marked what <hi>Amaziah the prieſt of Bethel</hi> did. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.2, 3. 3. It is a ſpecial meane taught by Satan, for driving on a courſe of perſecution, when perſecuters do delate the faithful ſervants of God unto Kings and Rulers, as enemies to them; and when, having Kings eares, they do informe againſt them behinde their back, when they know not of it, nor are admitted to ſpeak for themſelves: for, this was <hi>Amaziahs</hi> way, <hi>he ſent to Jeroboam King of Iſrael</hi> &amp;c. 4. It is the ordinary trick of perſecuters, and a great injury to theſe whom they informe, as well as to the party troubled, that they do miſrepreſent matters, and do hide the true cauſe of their ſplene, and onely pretend great friendſhip to authority, and accordingly hold out what may be plauſible to them, and effectual to ſharpen their rage againſt Gods ſervants, for, though his own intereſt really grieved him, and that <hi>Amos</hi> cried down his high places, as afterward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth; yet there is not a word of that in the delation, but onely of treaſon, and loſeing the Kings ſubjects one way or other by <hi>Amos</hi> preachings. 5. It is an old, but an injuſt ſcandal caſt upon faithful Miniſters, that by their free preaching, they are the trumpets of ſedition and rebellion, affronters of authority, and withdrawers of their ſubjects from their duty; for, ſuch is the charge againſt <hi>Amos, Amos hath conſpired againſt thee in the midſt of the houſe of Iſrael; the land is not able to bear all his words.</hi> Whereas <hi>Amos</hi> was his beſt friend, ſeeking his real good, and learning him how to prevent the loſeing both of himſelfe and his ſubjects; and to rebuke his ſin openly, being publick and general, I was not to affront him, but to apply a publick remedy to a publick inveterate evil; and to think otherwiſe, were for a man to lift up himſelfe againſt God, as if he ſhould not be reproved by him. And in a word, <hi>Amos</hi> doctrine could be intolerable to none, but ſuch as proclamed their contempt of God, and their own incorrigibleneſſe in ſin. 6. It is alſo an old and injuſt trick in calumniatours and perſecuters, to repeat
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:114928:254"/>
the doctrine of honeſt miniſters unfaithfully, in the eares of Rulers, by diminiſhing, perverting &amp; corrupting what they ſay; for, ſuch is the account that he gives of <hi>Amos</hi> doctrine. <hi>v.</hi> 11. for albeit he repeat truly concerning the captivity of the people, yet neither in that, nor what concerns the King, doth he repeat the cauſes procureing theſe ſtroaks, which <hi>Amos</hi> had clearly told; And he puts in <hi>Jeroboam</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in place of his houſe which <hi>Amos</hi> had threatned, <hi>v.</hi> 9. to ſet the King more on edge. 7. It is an evidence of the deſperate and deadly condition of a land, when a people do by ſin procure ſaddeſt judgements, and yet will not ſee them approaching, and are ready to perſecute any who tell them of their danger; for, ſuch was the temper of this falſe prieſt; He ſuppoſeth it a quarrel great enough, that <hi>Amos</hi> had told the Kings houſe and the land of their approaching hazard.</p>

                     <p>This courſe not ſucceeding, (as it ſeemes <hi>Jeroboam</hi> would not meddle with <hi>Amos,</hi> either out of feare or poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) he takes another courſe: And pretending friendſhip and a reſpect to the prophets good, He. 1. adviſeth him to leave that land and go to Judah; alledging that now he might go eaſily if he went ſoone; but if he fled not ſhortly, he was in hazard to be taken or ill intreated: and withal, he laieth before him how he might live bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Judah, and exerciſe his calling with more peace and fruit then in Iſrael, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 2. He adviſeth him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially not to propheſie any more in Beth el; and that becauſe it was the Kings <hi>Sanctuary</hi> (as the word will bear) appointed by him for publick worſhip, and ſo none might challenge it; and withal it was the Kings chappel, where he himſelfe performed publick worſhip; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:114928:254"/>
he could not endure any contradiction there, which would reflect both upon his authority enjoyning that worſhip, and upon his own practiſing of it. Likewiſe he tels him, that Beth el is <hi>the Kings Court,</hi> where he remains, and hath his reſidence at ſome times, eſpecially when he came to worſhip, or, <hi>the houſe of the Kingdome,</hi> a place of publick judicatories where his oppoſition could be leſſe hid or endured then elſewhere. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. As the Lord can when he will, diſappoynt and break the ſnares of perſecuters when they are moſt ſubtilly laid; (as here it appeareth <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did nothing upon this ſubtile and net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling deſolation:) So perſecuters are endleſſe in their projects, and when one faileth, they will be ſure to eſſay another; As the practice of this falſe prieſt may teach us. 2. As perſecuting enemies may pretend friendſhip, that they may overthrow Gods ſervants; So they are moſt dangerous when they do ſo, and do inſinuate by flattery, that they may ſuggeſt ill counſels, or otherwiſe enſnare them: for, this was <hi>Amaziahs</hi> laſt refuge to inſinuate with <hi>Amos,</hi> that he might be rid of him. And therefore he who counted but baſely of the prophet, and in his delation to the King calls him onely <hi>Amos,</hi> now he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates with him, and called him the <hi>Seer,</hi> a name given of old to prophets, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. He who would have incenſed the King againſt him, pretends now a great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude for his ſafety, good and eaſe, and that his hazard was from others onely; <hi>flee,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for thy ſelfe,</hi> (as it is in the original) or for thine own behoofe, <hi>and eat bread in Judah,</hi> which thou wilt not get here: And he who could not endure good doctrine, pretends that he is not againſt propheſying, but acknowledgeth it is good; onely he would not have his perſon in hazard, but let him propheſy with ſafety in Judah; <hi>propheſy there.</hi> So ſubtile are peſecuters, and can turn themſelves into ſo many ſhapes, that they have need of much light from God who would diſcern and avoyd them. 3. Whatever perſecuters, and eſpecially corrupt Church-men, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for their way, of zeal to Religion, or of reſpect to the ſervants of God, or to theſe whom they incenſe againſt them; Yet it is but themſelves, and their gain and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which is their ſnare and ſets them to worke: for, ſo much doth he diſcover in that particular counſel,
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:114928:255"/>
                        <hi>propheſie not at Bethel,</hi> though he tell not the true cauſes of that counſel; for, he drave his great trade there, and he was affraid leſt the Prophets doctrine ſhould bring down his market, and therefore he would be rid of him. 4. The diſcourſes and inſinuations of this ſubtile perſecuter, which were unſound, and nothing elſe but ſo many ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſnares laid in <hi>Amos</hi> way, may afford unto faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſters eſpecially, ſeveral cautions and directions in proſecuting their calling. And 1. Gods ſervants, as they muſt be ſimple, harmleſſe and innocent, ſo they muſt be wiſe and prudent, not truſting every flattering inſinuater, or giving ſimple credit to every inſinuation; Otherwiſe, they may get a perſecuting <hi>Amaziah</hi> in their boſome in place of a friend, and be drawn upon a ſnare. 2. It is a great ſnare, and very unbeſeeming the ſervants of God, to be affrighted in or for their duty, ſo as to abandon it; for, <hi>flee for thy ſelfe,</hi> as a man affrighted and minding onely his own ſafety, was an ill counſel. See. <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.10, 11. 3. A ſeeming creditable pretence of retreat will not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mens faithleſſe terrour in performing duty, or their neglect of it; for, though he propound <hi>fleeing to the land of Judah,</hi> as creditable enough to withdraw into his own Country and home, yet that is alſo but a ſnare. 4. Men muſt not abuſe providential opportunities concurring with other tentations, to withdraw them from their duty in a time of hazard, or to draw them any way wrong; for, albeit he propound his counſel, as that providence gave him now liberty of retreat, if he would <hi>flee</hi> and make haſte, and that he would not meet with the like again, when poſſibly he would deſire it; yet that was no ſufficient argument to <hi>Amos.</hi> Providence muſt never be ſo read, as to draw men from their duty revealed in Scripture. 5. A Miniſter muſt not make choice of places wherein to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his calling, according as he may get reſpect or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity thereby; But he muſt follow the call of God, whatever his lot be, or though it ſhould ſeeme he would be better elſewhere; for, it is but a poor argument that he may <hi>eat bread</hi> in Judah, and therefore ſhould leave Iſrael where he was not well reſpected nor entertained. 6. Miniſters muſt not quit a ſtation wherein God hath put them, pretending they do no good in it, and that they might be more uſeful elſewhere; But it is their duty to
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:114928:255"/>
ſow the ſeed of the word wherever he commands them, and let him make what uſe of their ſervice he pleaſeth; for, it is another unſound inſinuation in this counſel, that he might <hi>propheſie</hi> in Judah, and his calling be more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prove more ſucceſsful there, then in Iſrael. 7. Miniſters muſt not be allured with promiſes of immunity for by-gons, to omit duty for the future; for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſnare laid, <hi>propheſie not again any more at Bethel,</hi> which imports that nothing would be ſaid for what was paſt, If he took heed for time to come. 8. Faithful Miniſters muſt not be borne down, nor their hands weakened by the general applauſe and countenance given to ill courſes; But they muſt do their duty in oppoſing evils that are generally countenanced and cried up; for, it was <hi>Amos</hi> duty to <hi>propheſie at Bethel,</hi> and he did ſo, not onely becauſe it was a publick place to preach in, but he would witneſſe againſt their idolatry, in the place where their calves were worſhipped and moſt in requeſt. 9. Faithful Miniſters muſt not give way to this corrupt principle, that Rulers muſt not be controuled, but their will ſtand for a law in matters of Religion; and that it is a contempt of, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done to their authority, to warn them of their ſin; But they are bound to condemn both their injunctions in matters of Religion, and their practices, if they be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the word; for, it is no valid argument for ſilence at Bethel, that it is <hi>the Kings Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>Chappel.</hi> 10. Miniſters muſt not be dazzled with the greatneſſe of men, or danger of hazard from them, nor with eminency of places, in doing their duty: But they muſt ſet their faces like a flint againſt all ſuch diſcouragements and tentations; for, that Bethel is <hi>the Kings Court,</hi> or <hi>houſe of the Kingdome,</hi> is no ſufficient argument for <hi>Amos</hi> ſilence and flight.</p>

                        <hi>Amos,</hi> in this firſt part of his reply, doth aſſert his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to propheſie, particularly againſt Iſrael; ſhewing that he was extraordinarily called to it, when he dreamt not of it, but was earning his bread, and living ſoberly in a mean calling; and that before that calling came, he was neither <hi>a Prophet,</hi> nor ſo much as <hi>a Prophets ſon,</hi> that is, trained up in the ſchooles of the Prophets in order to that calling. See 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 6.1. But he was brought to it, as <hi>David</hi> to the Kingdome from following the ewes. And by this he cleareth that he propheſied not thus of his own head, or at the command of any other, but God onely; And that he never turned a prophet for his food, being meanely bred, and content with ſober diet. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A clear calling from God to any ſtation, is a ſweet ſupport under any diſtreſſe or oppoſition men may meet with in it: and they who have this, ought to be comforted in it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever come; for, <hi>Amos</hi> oppoſeth his cleare call to all theſe inſinuate hazards. 2. Albeit men be bound to means and to walke by a rule, yet God is not bound, but may call and employ whom he will, and make them able and eminent; for, of a mean herdman, he maketh an eminent Prophet. 3. No lawful calling how meane ſoever, is a diſparagement to any, but it is rather a commendation, when God laieth a mans lot low, that he ſtoops to a meane calling and keeps by it, and lives ſoberly in it; for, <hi>Amos</hi> thinks it no diſparagement, that he was <hi>an herdman, and a gatherer of ſycomore fruit,</hi> for himſelf and family, or poſſibly to ſell. 4. It is no diſparagement to the word, nor ſhould it be the leſſe reſpected, that meane men are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to carry it, ſeeing it is the word of God, in whoſe mouth ſoever it be; and the excellency of the power thereof is of God, and not of men; for, <hi>Amos</hi> thinks it no juſt ground of ſleighting the meſſage he carried, that <hi>the Lord took him as he followed the flock, and ſaid, Go propheſie</hi> &amp;c. 5. Where the Lord giveth a call and impoſeth a duty, he muſt be obeyed and followed, oppoſe who will; for, in anſwer to all that was ſaid for his fleeing to Judah, he aſſerts this, <hi>The Lord took me, and ſaid, Go propheſie to Iſrael.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 4.19. 6. The Lord evidenceth ſuch reſpect to a people in ſending his meſſengers unto them, that it is very odious in them to deſpiſe and loath ſuch a mercy; for, he upbraids their ingratitude with this, that it was in the Commiſſion, <hi>propheſie unto my people Iſrael.</hi>

                     <p>In the ſecond part of this reply, <hi>Amos</hi> in the Lords name threatens this falſe Prieſt for his preſumptuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of him to propheſie: and foretels that his wife ſhall be an open harlot (not ſo much forced by ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as voluntarily addicted to it) his children ſhall be ſlain, his land divided, and himſelf die in exile out of the holy land: And withal he declareth that however he would not hear of it, yet Iſrael ſhould certainly go into captivity. And it is very likely he went into captivity with them, either at the firſt or ſecond time, of which, 2. <hi>Kings,</hi> 15.29. and chap. 17. for it is not ſo many yeares betwixt the death of this <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and the laſt captivity, as ſhould make it altogether incredible. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Such as would hinder the courſe of Gods word, and oppoſe his ſervants in carrying of it, ſhall not miſſe a ſad word againſt themſelves; for, though this Prieſt deſerved this ſad ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence otherwiſe, yet this put the capſtone on all, <hi>Thou ſayeſt, propheſie not againſt Iſrael, and drop not thy word againſt the houſe of Iſaac.</hi> And for this phraſe, that propheſying is called <hi>dropping,</hi> See on <hi>Mic.</hi> 2.6. And even threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings againſt incorrigble people may be compared to <hi>drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> and rain, becauſe however they do not make a people fruitful, yet they proſper in what the Lord ſends them to do, as is ſaid in a certain caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.10, 11. 2. It is an ill uſe made of a peoples priviledges, when they are held up to ward off ſad meſſages, and do embolden them to deſpiſe the word; Therefore doth <hi>Amos</hi> mention his muſtering up of the titles of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>the houſe of Iſaac,</hi> in
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:114928:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
this matter, though it was not before recorded; It may be he preſſed <hi>Amos</hi> oftener then once, and was more boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at one time then another. 3. It is righteous with God to make oppoſers of the word, ſpectacles of his juſtice and indignation; and to let out judgements on corrupt Church-men, their families and enjoyments, ſutable to their abuſing of his Church and people in their calling; for, ſuch a procedure is to be ſeen in this ſentence againſt the Prieſt: He induced Gods Church to ſpiritual adultery; and <hi>his wife is an harlot in the city.</hi> See <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.13: He deſtroyed the ſouls of Gods children; and <hi>his ſons and daughters fall by the ſword.</hi> He was given to the world, and was a chiefe cauſe why Iſrael was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiled of their inheritance; and <hi>his land is divided by line,</hi> among the Conquerours. He was a chiefe cauſe of Iſraels exile, and would not let them beleeve it; and he gets the threatning verified on himſelf, and that without recovery, <hi>thou ſhalt die in a polluted land.</hi> And he polluted the holy land with idolatry; and he dies in a polluted land: 4. Whatever be the ſecure confidences of ſinners or ſeducers; yet theſe will not make void Gods threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, but he will refute all their dreames by reall ſtroaks: for, in oppoſition to what he would not beleeve himſelf, nor let the people beleeve, it is here again aſſerted, <hi>and Iſrael ſhall ſurely go into captivity, ſaith the Lord.</hi> 5. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the lot of the truly godly, yet it cannot but be ſad and bitter to wicked men, when they are made wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of theſe calamities which they occaſion and draw upon a people, by miſleading and hardning them in ſin; and when they ſhare deeply in them, and never ſee an end of them, but die under them; for, ſo much may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from this, that he lived till the captivity came, and drank ſo deep of that cup.</p>

                     <p>In theſe verſes, by the type of a basket of ſummer fruit, (which <hi>Amos</hi> is excited to conſider) is ſignified, that God will not plead any longer with them, nor wait any more upon them, or ſpare them. But as ſummer fruits do portend a ripe harveſt, or that it is near approaching; ſo their ſins were ſuch as made them ripe for deſtruction. And as ripe fruits are plucked down, and gathered into bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and eaten; So ſhould the greedy enemies devour and deſtroy them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. People that are neareſt deſtruction are ordinarily ſo ſtupid, that they need to be often told of their danger; And God ſeeth it ofttimes meet to give them frequent warnings, that they may be without excuſe; Therefore is this new type held forth with the explication thereof, containing the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that was ſpoken to chap. 7.7, 8. 2. As threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings according to the word, in the mouths of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, are of him, and not deviſed by them; (for, <hi>the Lord God ſhewed</hi> this type, and expounded it) So they have need to be ſtill of new excited to conſider what God reveals, and to have raiſed thoughts upon it; that ſo they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite others to the like attention; Therefore a <hi>Behold</hi> is prefixed to the type, and <hi>Amos</hi> is put to conſider it by a queſtion, <hi>Amos what ſeeſt thou?</hi> which points alſo at the duty of all who hear it. 3. Sin, though it be long forborne, will at laſt ripen and come to an height; and when it is ſo, the Lord will not ſpare, notwithſtanding his former long-ſuffering and moderation; So much doth this type point out, and the explication thereof; <hi>The end is come, I will not again paſſe by them any more,</hi> which is the ſame with chap. 7, 8. 4. It is mens duty to ſee that what God ſaieth may take deep impreſſion; And for
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:114928:258"/>
this end, as Miniſters ſhould avoid the wiſdom of words which corrupt the ſimplicity of Religion and the Goſpel: ſo it is lawful and needful that they expreſſe the matters of God ſo as may render them moſt taking, and make them ſtick faſteſt: Therefore is there not onely a type uſed, but in the Original there is an affinity in ſound and (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt) in the word, betwixt the type, <hi>ſummer fruits,</hi> and the thing ſignified, <hi>the end.</hi> And this is made uſe of to inculcate the matter, and cauſe it ſtick in their memory. 5. Men are ſo prone to lean to carnal confidences, and particularly, on their viſible intereſt in God, as if that would hold off deſerved judgements; that it is the duty of Gods ſervants, frequently to diſcover the deceitfulneſſe of ſuch a courſe; Therefore again do they get a name of intereſt in the ſentence, <hi>my people Iſrael,</hi> to ſhew that ſuch a pretence will faile them. 6. When God proceeds to ſeverity againſt his people, it will adde to the bitterneſſe thereof, that he had dealt otherwiſe, and they have made no uſe thereof; Therefore is it put in the ſentence, that he will not paſſe by them <hi>again, any more,</hi> as he had done formerly.</p>

                     <p>The greatneſſe of this near approaching calamity is held forth from two effectes. 1. That their joyful ſongs, even in their Temples and at their ſacred ſolemnities, ſhould ceaſe, and in place thereof, there ſhould be the howling of the afflicted. 2. That there ſhould be ſo great a mortality (by reaſon of ſword, or famine or peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or altogether) that they ſhould caſt the dead out of the way, or in common pits, and bury them without lamentation or publick ſolemnity. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. It is a ſad evidence of Gods diſpleaſure, when ſacred ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ceaſe, and nothing is left in place thereof but ſorrow and lamentation; for, ſo much doth this ſentence teach in general, whatever their Religion was. 2. Whatever be
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:114928:259"/>
the joy of the wicked, and their pleaſing of themſelves in their corrupt and idoratrous worſhip; yet it will at laſt end in ſorow; for, <hi>the ſongs of the temple ſhall be howlings in that day, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> 3. When God pleads a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with a Nation, it is righteous with him not onely to break their power, and bring them in ſubjection unto their enemies, but alſo to purſue particular perſons with plagues, to the cutting off of not a few of them: for, <hi>there ſhall be many dead bodies in every place.</hi> 4. Albeit it may be the lot even of the godly under calamities and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, to be cut off, and want burial, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.2, 3. Yet the want of ordinary burial, or to be buried without uſual decency and lamentation, is a judgement upon the wicked, wherein Gods hand is to be ſeen in pouring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them after they are dead, and ſtupifying the living with multitudes of calamities; for, it is a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>they ſhall caſt them forth with ſilence,</hi> where by <hi>ſilence</hi> is to be underſtood eſpecially, want of funeral lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſually among them; though chap. 6.10. it be taken in another ſenſe.</p>

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:114928:259"/>
ſwallowed them up by oppreſſion, ſo that they were made <hi>to fail</hi> or ceaſe, that is, they were not able to ſubſiſt, but were put off the world by their cruelty, <hi>v.</hi> 4. 2. That they wearied off dayes of ſolemnity and ſacred meetings (which they kept in imitation of Judah) and longed to have them over, that they might follow their gain, and ſatisfie their coveteous humours, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 3. That they were not onely covetous, and followed gain eagerly in a lawful calling, but they were both deceitful and cruel in their bargains. They both wronged and falſified the meaſuers whereby they ſold out their commodities, and their weights whereby they weighed the mony (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their cuſtome at that time) that came in unto them: They were not content to ſpoile the poor of their money, but got them made ſlaves and bondmen to them for a thing of nought; and though they had corrupted both meaſures and weights, yet they ſold not good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, but corrupted their wares, and made gain of the chaffe and refuſe of wheat, as if it were good, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The Lord would not have rods dumb, but ſpeaking to guilt; and when he threatens, it concerns the guilty to hear; and though they be averſe from it, yet God will make them hear ere all be done: Therefore is it ſubjoined to the former ſentence, <hi>Hear this, O ye</hi> &amp;c. 2. Oppreſſion of the poor is an inhumane beaſtly ſin, and a great cauſe of Gods controverſie againſt a land, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to prove himſelf higher then the higheſt, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.8 Therefore is this brought in as his quarrel, and pointed out as a beaſtly ſin; <hi>ye ſwallow up the needy,</hi> (or, <hi>pant</hi> and gape to get him ſwallowed down) <hi>even to make the poor of the land to fail.</hi> And albeit this be the ſin of the richer ſort onely, yet it is held out as the cauſe of the lands deſtruction; Becauſe, however the poorer have their own ſins, yet the greater ſort are ordinarily ring-leaders in procuring National judgements; and it may be here, the meaner followed the footſteps of the greater, ſo far as they had power. 3. As the covetous are never without their own ſorrows, were they never ſo thriving, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. ſo it is matter of ſad challenge, when the cares of the world turn an enemy unto, and make men weary of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and attendance upon the duties thereof; And when men not onely have their hearts upon the world
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:114928:260"/>
on ſabbaths and times of religious duties, but do look on all theſe as diſtractions, and matters in the by, and make the world and gain their great earand: for, this was their fault here, <hi>When will the new moon be gone, that we may ſell corn? and the ſabbath, that we may ſet forth wheat?</hi> They mention onely <hi>ſabbaths</hi> and <hi>new moons,</hi> though they had other ſolemnities, becauſe theſe recurred more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and other ſolemnities came about but once a year, and therefore did not ſo often vexe them. And if this was a land deſtroying ſin, how much more is God provoked when men dare openly by actions profane the Sabbath, and neglect duties of worſhip? See <hi>Neh.</hi> 13.15, 16. &amp;c. 4. When men do make a prey of the poor by falſifying of wares, meaſures, weights and coine, they will finde that they do highly provoke God, whatever they gain thereby; for, ſuch is the challenge, <hi>they make the ephah ſmall, and the ſhekel great,</hi> by adding to the weight whereby it is weighed; They <hi>falſifie the balances by deceit,</hi> either in weighing money or other commodities, and they <hi>ſell the refuſe of the wheat.</hi> 5, As the Lord ſeeth it meet to exerciſe ſome with poverty, and by putting them in the reverence of great men; ſo their condition is not onely an exerciſe to themſelves, but a trial to others, wherein God takes ſpecial notice how they are intreated; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Lord challenge for what they did to <hi>the poor and needy.</hi> 6. Albeit oppreſſion in the matter of goods and means be very intolerable and horrid, yet that is but little in compariſon of injuries done to the perſons of men, and when for ſmall things the poor are brought in bondage, ſlavery or reſtraint; for, <hi>they buy the poor for ſilver, and the needy for a pair of ſhoes,</hi> or, for a mean thing they made bondmen of them, abuſing that law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.39.</p>

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:114928:260"/>
would enſue, the Lord having ſworn by himſelf that he would not forget their carriage, but put all their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon their account till he return them a meet recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. When wrath is moſt deſerved, and ready to be let forth, men are ordinarily leaſt ſenſible, and will leaſt beleeve it; Therefore muſt the ſentence be again confirmed by an oath, which is the third time an oath is given in this prophecy. See chap. 4.2. and 6.8. 2. The Lord ſwears here <hi>by the excellency of Jacob,</hi> which is himſelf, ſeeing he cannot ſwear by another, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.13. and he is expresſly called the <hi>excellency</hi> or <hi>glory</hi> of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.32. And by this title, he would teach, 1. That nothing beſide God, can make a people truly excellent, enjoy what dignity and excellency they will. 2. That it is the great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and dittay of a people, when being excellent through him, they do not acknowledge him, nor walk anſwerable; for, it is to aggreage their ſin, that he gives himſelf this title in this ſentence. 3. That whatever be mens confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in their priviledges; Yet when they provoke God, they will be diſappointed; yea, their ſin will turn what they gloried moſt in, to plead againſt them: Therefore alſo is this brought in, in the ſentence. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Oaths, when men are called to give them, ſhould be taken and given with much gravity, reverence and dread; for, ſo much may be imported in the way of this oath of the Lord, which is in the Original, <hi>if I ever forget</hi> &amp;c. which imports not onely the certainty of what he ſwears, as it is tranſlated, and therefore the certification is ſuppreſſed in ſilence; But this covering of it in ſilence doth import, that men in giving an oath, ſhould tremble at the very mentioning of what will follow, if they ſweare falſly. 4. Albeit an impenitent people, when they are ſpared, do think that all is forgotten; Yet they have Gods word and oath for it, that where pardon is not obtained through Chriſt, the account is but growing, and that all their ſins, leſſer and greater, will at laſt be brought forth, to make their caſe the ſadder when he reckons for all together; for ſaith he, <hi>Surely, I will never forget any of their works.</hi> He will remember all of them, and not any of them but they ſhall be brought out in the proceſſe.</p>

                     <p>In the ſecond branch of this enlargement of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is declared, that as the very land might be aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed and ſhake at their provocations (which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences could tell them was deſerved) ſo it ſhould be filled with horrible confuſions cauſing all to lament. And that they ſhould no more get dwelling or abiding in it, then if it were drowned and overflowed, as Egypt is at ſome ſeaſons by the River Nilus. This ſeemeth to be the ſenſe of this verſe; the firſt part thereof concerning <hi>the lands trembling,</hi> imports not onely that the inſenſible earth might tremble under ſuch a burden of ſin and ſinners, and be ready to teſtifie its indignation againſt them (as it may be he ſpeaks this, about the time of that earthquake, chap. 1. 1. and pointing at it) But further it imports, there ſhould be horrible confuſions upon the land (as if it were trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling) to caſt them out of it, and make them mourn, as it is ſubjoined; and ſo the ſpeech is taken, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 60.2. and 75. 3. The ſecond part of the verſe illuſtrates their calamities by the ſimile of a deluge; and as before the lands trembling is brought in to point out the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and confuſions they were to meet with upon it; ſo alſo theſe things here are applied to the earth, which befel them upon it. The parts of the ſimile are. 1. <hi>It ſhall riſe up wholly as a flood,</hi> or, <hi>as with a flood,</hi> and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; That as waters riſe up and cover a land (for, ſo the ſenſe is, though the land be ſaid to riſe up) ſo ſhould their land be overflowed with calamities, that they could not abide on it, and (as the Original word will alſo beare) in ſhould <hi>evaniſh</hi> and come to nothing, <hi>as with a flood,</hi> that is, it ſhould be ſo covered as not to appeare, and they have no more uſe of it then if it were not. 2. <hi>If ſhall be caſt out,</hi> that is, as the Sea and deluges are reſtleſſe and do ſtill toſſe and caſt out the ſlime and mire which they raiſe (and ſo the ſame word is expreſſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57, 20.) ſo the land
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:114928:261"/>
ſhould be ſhaken and diſquieted with trouble, that it might ſpew them out, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.22. 3. (Which clears all the former) <hi>it ſhall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt,</hi> ſo that they cannot dwell on it: <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. How ſound ſoever impenitent ſinners ſleep, and how incredible and injuſt ſoever they may think it were, that God ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them: Yet their greateſt unfriend is in their own boſome, and it is their great madneſſe that they do not conſider how much their conſciences will have to plead for God in a day of rebuke, and how ſad that pleading will be; Therefore are they ſo often put to it, in this matter, by theſe queſtions. 2. Albeit the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants be accounted, by reaſon of their faithful doctrine, the diſturbers of the earth, as chap. 7.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 17.6. Yet it is mens own ſins that diſturb it, and draw on all theſe confuſions they meet with: for, it is <hi>for this the land trembleth,</hi> and there are ſo many confuſions upon it. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.12. 3. Albeit ſinners ſleep ſecurely in their ſin, yet the very creatures may bear witneſſe againſt their ſtupidity, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.12. And albeit they feare no dangers; yet the very creatures are ready upon a call, to teſtifie their indignation againſt them; for, ſo much alſo doth <hi>the lands trembling,</hi> as it is before explained, import; to wit, that the inſenſible earth was more affected then they, and groaning under that burden, and that it was a wonder that it did not perpetually quake, till it ſwallowed them, as <hi>Num.</hi> 16.31, 32. 4. Albeit ſinners, when they ſee that ſtroaks will come on, will not be moved for all that, but be ready to harden themſelves againſt them; yet God will make them to ſmart under his rods; and he will do ſo to all who are guilty, as well as to one: for, <hi>every one ſhall mourn that dwelleth therein.</hi> 5. When men ſettle upon their dregs, and ſeek to root themſelves in the earth, it is righteous with God to give them a diſappointment, and that he ſend calamities comparable to the greateſt accidents in the world, to ſhake them out of their neſts, and to overflow all their enjoyments; So much is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, in that <hi>it ſhall riſe up wholly as a flood, and it ſhall be caſt out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</hi>

The word of the Lord ſhould be, and is unto the Soule what food is to the body, for refreſhing and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, for keeping it in life, and enabling to acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and work; Therefore is the want thereof called <hi>famine in the land.</hi> See <hi>Job</hi> 23.12. 2. When the word is deſpiſed, and men be weary of it, God is juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to take it from them; for, whereas the falſe prieſt expreſſeth, their general temper, chap. 7.12, 13. now <hi>the dayes come, Saith the Lord God, that I will ſend a famine in the land, of hearing the words of the Lord.</hi> 3. As mens Souls are better then their bodies, and their eternal welfare to be preferred to a natural life; So a famine of the word is a ſadder ſtroak, and ſpeaks more wrath, then if the Lord ſhould let a Nation ſtarve for want of meat and drink: Therfore is it expreſſed ſo as <hi>not a famine for bread, nor a thirſt for water</hi> (which were a ſmall matter in compariſon of this) <hi>but of hearing the words of the Lord;</hi> And therefore alſo is a <hi>Behold</hi> prefixed to it. 4. Greateſt deſpiſers of the word, and they who would think it their great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be rid of the trouble thereof, may yet come into extremities wherein they ſhall miſſe the word, and would be glad of it, and take much pains to enjoy it; for, <hi>they ſhall wander, and run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord.</hi> 5. It is righteous with God, that they who contemne the word, when it is offered, and do miſſe and ſeek it in trouble, onely out of the ſenſe of calamities, to get eaſe of them, and not out of any ſenſe of ſin, or deſire of true ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort; It is righteous, I ſay, with God, that ſuch ſhould come no ſpeed in ſeeking after the word, though they take never ſo much pains to run through all the corners of the land: for, <hi>they ſhall wander from ſea to ſea, and from the north even to the eaſt, they ſhall run to and fro to ſeek the word of the Lord, and ſhall not finde it.</hi> Where in aſſigning, the borders of the land, the onely difficulty is, that as the great ſea was on the weſt, ſo the other is placed ſouth, which elſewhere is ſaid to lie eaſtward. But it ſufficeth us, that however the dead ſea lay eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Judah, yet it lay ſouth or ſoutheaſt to Iſrael; or, it may be conceived, that the ſea on the ſouth is the red ſea, which ſometime is put for the border of the land, Exod. 23.31. It is further to be conſidered, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſpeak of their wandering with relation to the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:114928:263"/>
bounds of the land of Canaan, yet it appeareth not that they had that want before their captivity; for not onely had they prophets ſtill in Judah, if they had been ſo earneſt, but it is probable <hi>Hoſea</hi> continued till their final captivity; But as it is uſual to deſcribe the ſeveral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the earth with relation to the borders of Canaan, and under the ſame names; So it ſeemeth to be the ſenſe, that in their exile, they ſhould ſeek for the word in all quaters, and not finde it</p>

And this not onely contains a threatning, but poynts out alſo another cauſe (together with their oppreſſion, <hi>v.</hi> 4.5.6.) of theſe threatned judgements. Their idolatrous worſhip is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>ſwearing,</hi> which is frequently put for all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious worſhip, as is marked on <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. And ſeveral ſorts of it are expreſſed here; And namely, that they did ſwear by their Idols which were maintained by their chief city Samaria, though it was their ſin and not their God; That though they pretended to worſhip the true God in this, and to ſwear by his name; Yet they did not honour him as he revealed himſelfe in his word, and is acknowledged in his true Church; but did ſwear by him as he was worſhiped in Dan, and by the God whoſe way and manner of ſervice they had erected at Beerſheba. And ſo they gave that honour to their Idols and calves immediately, and pretended to offer it to God onely in and by theſe Idols. Doct. 1. God hath a ſpecial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie againſt Idolaters and corrupters of Religion in his Church; Therefore is there a peculiar threatning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch. 2. The true God will not acknowledge any ſervice as done to him, which is offered in any Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous way, and in and by Idols and Images: Nor will he acknowledge that he is the God, who is worſhipped and acknowledged in ſuch away; for, albeit to ſwear by the true God, be a part of his worſhip; Yet he makes it a quarrel that they ſwear by him as repreſented by their Idols, and as he is ſerved in Dan, and in Beerſheba after their devices; <hi>They ſwear by the ſin of Samaria, and ſay, Thy God, O Dan liveth, and the manner of Beerſheba liveth.</hi> 3.

When men reckon rightly, they will finde that Idolatry is their great ſin, and the
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:114928:264"/>
chiefe cauſe of Gods quarrel, and not the matter of their confidence; Therefore it ſhall be called <hi>the ſin of Samaria.</hi> 5.

And ſo as they were chalenged and ſentenced together, Chap. 6. ſo here over again, this ſentence is confirmed to be irrevocable againſt both. And by the Lords joyning of Judah (who had ſome forme of external lawful worſhip) and their Temple, in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with Idolatrous Iſrael, he would let them ſee what great cauſe they had to be affraid. Withal they are thus joyned in the ſentence, that ſo way may be made for the following promiſes, <hi>v.</hi> 8.9, 11. &amp;c. which are common to both.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt part of this chap. by a new type and viſion is ſignified the cutting off of the Nation of Iſrael (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Judah alſo) both great and ſmall, wherein there ſhould be no eſcaping, <hi>v.</hi> 1. ſeeing there is no ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God when he purſues in anger, as he would do them, <hi>v.</hi> 2.3, 4. which is further confirmed from the great power of God, <hi>v.</hi> 5.6. and their ſinfulneſſe and baſeneſſe, <hi>v,</hi> 7. In the ſecond part of the chap. this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and the reſt of theſe hard meſſages, are ſweetened and moderated by a twofold promiſe. Firſt, (which qualifies the extremity thereof for the preſent) that God will ſpare a remnant in the midſt of theſe calamities, and that though he deſtroyed the prophane body of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:114928:265"/>
yet he will reſerve them, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and will not loſe them, however he ſcatter and toſſe the Nation, <hi>v.</hi> 9. and do cut off prophane Atheiſts, <hi>v.</hi> 10. Secondly, (which followeth upon the former in due time) he promiſeth to reſtore the Church of Iſrael, and raiſe up a Goſpel Church under Chriſt, comparable to the condition of Iſrael of old, <hi>v.</hi> 11. to enlarge the Church by the addition of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles unto them, <hi>v,</hi> 12. to bleſſe them with proſperity, <hi>v.</hi> 13.

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>The ſcope of the type and ſumme of the ſentence in this <hi>v,</hi> is, that by the Lords command to his inſtruments to ſmite the lintel of the door, till the poſts upholding it do ſhake, is ſignified not onely the deſtruction of the Temple, but the cutting off of great and ſmall of the people, which is declared to be a ſtroak which none of them ſhould eſcape. Doct. 1. Deſpiſed ordinances will at laſt bring ſad judgements, and mens conceit of their ſervice, and Gods former ſavour and acceptance thereof, will not hold it off; So much is ſignified by <hi>the Lords ſtanding upon,</hi> or <hi>beſide the Alter,</hi> which not onely imports that his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is now removed from the mercy ſeat, and come that length, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.3. and that he is <hi>ſtanding</hi> ready to execute his judgements; but that the ſentence cometh from the abuſed Altar, and that God cares for no other ſacrifice there, but a ſacrifice of men: and that the place of propitiation where they thought to pleaſe him, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſinned, is now turned into a ſeat of juſtice. Therefore alſo is the Commiſſion given to the execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers while they ſtand beſide the brazen Altar, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.2. Even Gods mercy-ſeat will be terrible to impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:114928:265"/>
2. Gods ſmiting of his own houſe is a ſad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to a people; and his not ſparing his own Church, may cauſe others tremble who are yet worſe then they; for, therefore is uſe made of ſuch a type, <hi>he ſaid</hi> (to his prepared inſtruments) <hi>ſmite the lintel of the door</hi> (which was graven with flowers, and ſo gets the name from them) <hi>that the poſts may ſhake,</hi> whereby is ſignified that he was to deſtroy that Temple and the ſervice thereof, as a pledge of Judah's ruine, and by this ſentence againſt Judah, he lets Iſrael ſee what they may expect. And albeit this ſmiting of <hi>the lintel of the door,</hi> and <hi>ſhaking of the poſts,</hi> may import that it is a chiefe mean of ruining a Church, when the doors of diſcipline and order are broken down; yet that is not to be ſtrictly preſſed, but the general ſcope is to ſhew that it ſhould be a ruinous houſe. And withal, beſide what relates to the Temple it ſelfe, it may point at what is further typified thereby, that as the ſtroak on the lintel did ſhake the poſts, ſo the ruine of the Nation ſhould begin at the ſtroaks that were to come upon the great ones, as is after cleared. 3. When God is angry againſt a Nation, he will not ſpare great nor ſmall, but by cutting off theſe in eminency, he will expoſe the people to ruine; for, as ſmiting the lintel made the poſts to ſhake, ſo ſaith he, <hi>cut them in the head all of them,</hi> (or cut the head and great ones) <hi>and I will ſlay the laſt of them</hi> (or the meaner ſort) <hi>with the ſword.</hi> 4. However men may think to ſecure themſelves when God is angry, yet all will be in vain; There is no way of eſcaping his indignation, nor will probable means ſecure them; for, <hi>he that fleeth of them, ſhall not flee away,</hi> but ſhall be over taken, <hi>and he that eſcapeth of them,</hi> from one ſtroak, or at one time, <hi>ſhall not be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi> from another ſtroak, or at another time.</p>

                     <p>This laſt part of the ſentence, concerning their not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping, is further amplified and enlarged, wherein it is declared that wherever they can flee to for ſhelter, he is omnipreſent and able to reach them, and will do ſo. Though they ſhould dig into hell or the depths of the earth, or climbe up to heaven, yet he will take them and bring them down; In tops of mountains he will finde them out; in depths of the Sea, he hath monſters ready to bite and devour them; and their thinking to eſcape by yeelding unto enemies, and being carried into captivity, will not for all that preſerve them from the ſword. It is alſo further declared, that the Lord will do all this in his great diſpleaſure againſt them, which ſhall watch over them for evil and not for good. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. Secure and and preſumptuous ſinners are endleſſe in multiplying falſe confidences; and even when trouble breaks out upon them, they will not be driven to God, nor ſee their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame danger, but are ready to think they will finde wayes abundant to get out; for, ſo is here imported in all theſe ſuppoſitions of <hi>digging to hell, climbing to heaven</hi> &amp;c. which ſhew how many ſhiftes they dreamed of to avoid this ſentence, even albeit it ſhould break forth in execution. 2. Among other deluding confidences, whereby ſecure ſinners think to ſhelter themſelves, this is one, that they think their captivity and former troubles lying on, ſhould be a reaſon why no more ſhould be laid upon them; Therefore is that brought in among the reſt, <hi>though they go into captivity before their enemies,</hi> becauſe they reckoned that being already captives, either their enemies with whom they had capitulate, would ſpare them or God who had thus afflicted them, would therefore forbeare to ſtrike them any more. 3. All the defences creatures can ſeek unto, are to no purpoſe againſt an angry

God, were they more then they are; He is omnipreſent, and cannot be fled from, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7.8. &amp;c. He is powerful to deſtroy, having armies and inſtruments of vengeance everywhere: for, ſo is here held out, and all theſe ſuppoſitions of climbing to heaven, digging to hell, hiding in the bottom of the ſea &amp;c are here produced, not that they could do ſo much for their own ſafety, but to ſhew how vain their confidences were, ſeeing albeit they could do much more, yet it would not availe them. 4. It is righteous with God not to reſt ſatisfied with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing, yea and captivity of an incorrigible and impenitent people, but to purſue them with the ſword in all the corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers where they are carried captives; for, ſo is threatned here, <hi>Though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence will I command the ſword, and it ſhall ſlay them.</hi> See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.2. 5. It is a ſad addition to the weight and bitterneſſe of ſtroaks, when they flow from anger, and are inflicted in diſpleaſure; Therefore it is added to the reſt, <hi>and I will ſet mine eyes upon them for evil</hi> &amp;c. which is borrowed from among men, who as they look with delight on theſe they affect, ſo their anger againſt theſe they are diſpleaſed with, appeares in their lookes, and their watching all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, to be about with them. 6. God purſuing in anger is too ſore a party for a ſinner; He can take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of them at every ſtep, to deprive them of all good, and afflict them with all kinde of evils: and when ſinners are ſo croſſed and afflicted on every hand, they are bound to read the vigilant diſpleaſure and ſeverity of God in it; for, ſo much is imported in this, <hi>I will ſet mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good,</hi> that he will be (ſo to ſay) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and watchful to reach them, as he can eaſily do. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.11. and this is yet the ſadder, that a reconciled people have a contrary promiſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.6.</p>

Likewiſe that paſſage, <hi>v.</hi> 6. he <hi>hath founded his troup in the earth,</hi> may alſo be thus underſtood, that he hath eſtabliſhed the earth as <hi>a bundle</hi> (as the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies) and a foundation to that ſtately fabrick of the heaven and ſtories thereof, whereof mention is formerly made. Or, that <hi>he hath founded his bundle upon</hi> (or <hi>beſide) the earth,</hi> that is, the ſea, or gathering together of waters, which God hath ſet bounds unto, and made it one globe with the earth. Any of theſe interpretations may well enough conſiſt with the ſcope, which is to ſet forth the great power of God. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. It is one great ſin and ſnare of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:114928:267"/>
ſinners, that they little conſider what God is with whom they have to do; and that much pains will not ſo make him known to them, as they may ſee him formidable while they are in a ſinful courſe: Therefore is ſo much pains taken to inculcate this doctrine. 2. General no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Gods eſſence and power are not ſufficient to make ſinners know him, unleſſe they ſtudy to conſider him more diſtinctly, as he reveals himſelfe; Therefore it is not enough to ſay he is <hi>the Lord God of hoſts,</hi> but it is further declared who he is, and wherein that appears, <hi>it is he that toucheth the land</hi> &amp;c. 3. Albeit the earth be all that carnal men deſire, and do reſt upon, when they may enjoy it; yet it is eaſie for God to make the earth feele his power, when men will not tremble; and to make it uncomfortable and full of ſorrow to them, and drive them from off the face thereof with deluges of troubles: for, it is <hi>he who toucheth the land, and it ſhall melt, and all that dwell therein ſhall mourn, and it ſhall riſe up wholly like a flood</hi> &amp;c. 4. Gods power and dominion is univerſal, in heaven and earth, in ſea and dry land, ſo that there is no eſcaping of him: And the glory of his power doth ſhine and may be read in the creating of the glorious heavens, and ordering of the ſeveral regions of the aire, and all that is in them; in eſtabliſhing of the earth and ſeas, and in having ſo many armies at his command, ready to execute his command againſt his enemies; All this is held forth in this deſcription of God, as it is before explained, it is <hi>he that buildeth his ſtories in the heavens, and and hath founded his troup in the earth.</hi> And theſe viſible and ordinary evidences of Gods power are ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, partly, to ſhew how much of him doth ſhine in theſe, though they be little obſerved by moſt for that end; partly, to ſhew how much of him ſpiritual mindes will ſee in theſe things, having ſo broad a book open wherever they turn them: But chiefly to ſhew how ſtupide this people was now become, that they did not take up the dreadfulneſſe of God, as he revealed himſelfe in his word to his Church; but they muſt be led out to ſtudy him in theſe things whereby he reveals himſelfe to all the world, as well as to them. 5. Gods power over the waters, to call them out of the ſea, and pour them out on the earth, may alſo ſerve to affright impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:114928:268"/>
when they conſider how he can raiſe up and bring about their calamities in a ſtrange and inſenſible way; as vapours are inſenſibly drawn out of the ſea, and gathered in clouds above our heads and then poured down; And when they conſider how he can and will alter the courſe of nature, and overturn what ſeemeth moſt eſtabliſhed, before they want a ſcourge; as when he cauſeth the ſea tranſgreſſe the bounds ſet unto it, and overflow the earth; Therefore alſo is this inſtance made uſe of, <hi>He calleth for the waters of the ſea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth.</hi> 6. God is then rightly ſeen and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in his workings, when he is taken up to be Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah, who is of himſelfe, and from whom is the beginning and continuance of the being of all the creatures; and therefore to be adored and obeyed by all; Therefore is it ſubjoined to all this, <hi>Jehovah is his Name.</hi>

                     </epigraph>
                     <p>A further confirmation of this ſentence is taken from their ſinfulneſſe, and ill deſervings. For, whereas they might object againſt this ſad ſentence, that they were come of religious and holy Progenitours, and were adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be his peculiar people; He declareth not onely that he did that freely, but that their carriage was more like the Ethiopians, then the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or Iſraelites; and therefore he would deale with them as ſuch. And whereas they might reply, that he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a peculiar intereſt in them, by delivering them from Egypt; He anſwers that the like external favour had been ſhewed to the Philiſtians and Syrians, and they needed no more boaſt of the one, then they of others the like, ſince their behaviour was no better then theirs. As for what is ſaid of the Philiſtines, that he <hi>brought them from Caphtor,</hi> we finde indeed that they and the <hi>Caphtorims</hi> were of one ſtock of people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.14. But it is not ſo clearely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:114928:268"/>
in Scripture how they were brought out from <hi>Caphtor,</hi> whether it was, that after the <hi>Caphtorims</hi> had cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated them in their country, the Lord had delivered them from thence by his providence, and brought them to the land they now poſſeſſed: Or whether they and theſe of <hi>Caphtor</hi> were incorporated in one people, and were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from ſome common ſlavery in their own country, and brought to the country they now dwelt in. Yet this laſt ſeemes to be more aggreeable to what is elſewhere recorded, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.23. where <hi>the Caphtorims</hi> are ſaid to have poſſeſſed the land of the <hi>Avims,</hi> even unto <hi>Azzah</hi> or <hi>Gaza.</hi> And <hi>Jer.</hi> 47.4. the Philiſtines are alſo called <hi>the remnant of the country of Caphtor.</hi> As for the other inſtance of bringing <hi>the Syrians,</hi> or <hi>Aramites</hi> (and not the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as diverſe of our tranſlations read it) <hi>from Kir,</hi> we finde that they were to be carried captive to <hi>Kir</hi> about this time, or ſhortly after, chap. 1.5. 2. <hi>Kings</hi> 16.9. But it is not ſo ſafe to underſtand this paſſage here as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their future return from thence, ſpoken of as if it were already done. For the Prophet is convincing them by things already done, and it ſeemes rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to ſome old ſtory, not mentioned elſewhere, of their deliverance from thence, and when the Aſſyrians ſubdued them, they ſent them back thither again, as run-awayes are returned to their old Maſters. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. A ſinful peoples priviledges are turned by them into a great ſnare, whileas it hides from them the odiouſneſſe of their ſin, and the puniſhments they deſerve thereby; Therefore muſt this be refuted, and their condition pointed out in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive colours to them. 2. Whatever marks of favour God put upon a people, differencing them from others, yet they have no cauſe of boaſting thereof before him who gave it, and made the difference; for, <hi>are not ye as children of the Ethiopians unto me?</hi> may import ſo much, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him they were nothing better of themſelves, but were all of them his creatures, and all alike unworthy and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, till he of free grace made them to differ, and what they had, was all his own and of him. See <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.6, 7, 8. 3. Whatever priviledges be conferred upon a viſible Church, yet that will not hide their ſin and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, nor do they ſecure them againſt Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when they ſin, far leſſe do they afford them cauſe of
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:114928:269"/>
boaſting; for, ſo much is further and more expesſly held forth here, <hi>are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me,</hi> (or I account of you as ſuch) <hi>O children of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord?</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.44. 4. Not onely will not privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges hide a peoples ſin; but as a priviledged people may ſtrangly degenerate, ſo the Lord will account them as baſe as the baſeſt of the people, when they do ſo, and ſo much the baſer as they have ſinned againſt ſo great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and being in ſuch a ſtate, as he advanced them unto: Therefore are they reſembled to and compared with, not every fort of people, but <hi>the Ethiopians</hi> (whether Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or the Southerne Ethiopians, I will not determine) either becauſe the colour of that people points out Iſraels incorrigibelneſſe in ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. or rather becauſe theſe Nations were deſcended of curſed <hi>Cham,</hi> and were in themſelves barbarous and eminently naughty and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as in ſome particulars is remarked of the Arabians, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.2. 5. Albeit Gods mercy doth ſhine very eminently in the many outward deliverances granted to his Church; Yet as wicked Nations may get many outward common favours alſo: So the Church hath no more cauſe to boaſt and glory of the one, then they of the other, as an evidence of Gods favour toward her, when yet ſhe provokes God, and walks not anſwerable to theſe mercies, but reſts upon them, not thirſting after the ſpiritual mercies offered unto her: Therefore is their glorious deliverance from Egypt, compared with what the Philiſtines and Syrians had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becauſe that albeit this elſewhere be inculcate as a ſpecial mercy; Yet ſinning Iſrael making no uſe thereof, had no more cauſe to expect favour in that condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that mercy, then other Nations might build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the common favours that were beſtowed on them: And becauſe that mercy was notable and ſingular in ſo far as it pointed at their ſpiritual deliverance through Chriſt; and therefore it was but an outward ſhell and common favour, when they ſought not after this. 6. Albeit ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſinners lull themſelves aſleep upon their priviledges, and the outward proofes of love they receive; yet their own conſciences can tell them that it cannot be a ſound ſleep, and that no priviledges of a viſible Church can be a ſhelter for ſin, nor former favours ſecure them for the future; Therefore is all this put to their own conſciences by theſe queſtions, as frequently before.</p>

                     <p>Hitherto <hi>Amos</hi> hath in this Prophecy onely denounced hard things againſt this incorrigible people, ſaving that ſometime he hath made ſome gracious offers, if they would repent, and conſidering that there was no hope of that, did return to threaten again. Now in the cloſe of the prophecy, all this doctrine is ſweetened with a twofold comfortable promiſe. In the firſt whereof, theſe hard tidings are corrected with a promiſe of moderation and preſerving a remnant under theſe calamities, till better dayes ſhould come under the Goſpel, which is the ſumme of the ſecond promiſe. The firſt promiſe is propounded in this <hi>v.</hi> That though he have an eye upon their wayes, and do purpoſe for their ſin to deſtroy the profane body of the people, and to make them ceaſe from being a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Yet he will not utterly deſtroy all the people, but preſerve ſome, becauſe of the Covenant, and becauſe of the elect of them, and of their poſterity who were to ſpring of them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. A people confederate with God may come to that height in ſin, as to be juſtly accounted a ſinful kingdom, not onely becauſe of the corruption of Rulers in it, but becauſe of the general overſpreading of impiety and wickedneſſe; Therefore it gets the name of <hi>the ſinful kingdome.</hi> 2. As God doth obſerve the wayes of all Nations, to puniſh them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; ſo eſpecially he doth ſo toward his Church and people; and his obſervance of their debordings, and his ſtroaks upon them, will be eſpecially remarkable; for, ſaith he, <hi>Behold,</hi> (as a thing to be remarked) <hi>the eyes of the Lord are upon the ſinful kingdome, and I will deſtroy it.</hi> 3. The Lords confedrate people may ſo far miſcarry, as to provoke him to conſume them ſo as (beſide the general cutting off of particular perſons) they ſhall not have the face of a Nation upon the earth; for, of this Iſrael is a ſad inſtance, <hi>I will deſtroy it from off the face of the earth.</hi> 4. Even
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:114928:270"/>
when God deals with his people in greateſt extremity, there is ſtill moderation toward them, and under ſaddeſt diſpenſations, they will meet with ſome proofe of love; for, this threatning hath an exception ſubjoyned. 5. As the Lords preſerving a remnant of his people under calamities, (even though they be ſcattered and afflicted, and the face of their Nation extinguiſhed) is a ſufficient reaſon why they ſhould not murmur, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.22, 39. and being well emproven, may pretend much future good to them, how ſad ſoever their cauſe may be for preſent; So, in particular, the Lord will never utterly conſume his ancient people Iſrael, but doth preſerve a remnant of them, to witneſſe that their election ſtands faſt, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their long and ſad afflictions, ready to be manifeſted in glorious effects in due time; for, <hi>I will not utterly deſtroy the houſe of Jacob, faith the Lord.</hi>

                     <p>This promiſe is further confirmed and illuſtrate from a ſimilitude, Wherein is declared, that as men when they ſift and winnow corne to put away the chaffe, will not loſe any of the good grain; So however their Kingdom was to ceaſe, and the people to be ſcattered into captivity, and toſſed with wandering, yet he will not loſe his elect, and a remnant. The meaning of this is not that in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing theſe calamlties, he would put a viſible difference betwixt the elect and reprobate; for as no doubt many elect ones periſh by the ſword in their own land, as well as others, ſo the elect who went into captivity with the reſt were toſſed as well as they, as the ſimilitude holds forth. But the meaning is, that he will ſo by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence order their ſcattering, as none of his elect ſhall periſh eternally, and ſo as he will not loſe a remnant of that people, out of whom his elect are to ſpring in due time, and whom he will make as good grain, to grow up to a fair harveſt, and become a glorious Church to him.
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:114928:270"/>
Doct. 1. Captivity and ſcattering and wandering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſtrange Nations, is a ſad and ſharp trial, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they may be exerciſed who eſcape the fury of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſword; for, ſuch is their trial here, <hi>I will ſift the houſe of Iſrael among all Nations.</hi> 2. It is the Lords hand which is to be looked unto and acknowledged in the exile and ſcattering of his ſinful people, And it ſhould not paſſe without an eſpecial remark, that he proſecutes his controverſie ſo, and that he makes all meanes ſo effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual for driveing them from their enjoyments into exile, and for their diſquiet and toſſing in it; Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Lo, I will command, and I will ſift,</hi> &amp;c. 3. Such ſad lots as theſe coming upon the Lords people, are for ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: Thereby the Lord doth narrowly try, and bring out what droſſe and chaffe, and what ſoundneſſe and ſincerity is in every mans boſome, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.31. and thereby alſo he lets out the winde of his diſpleaſure upon the light and empty chaffe of wicked men, that abound among his people in the day of their proſperity; and doth refine and purge his people, and fit them for, and give them eſpecial proofes of his favour and love: Therefore, ſaith he, <hi>I will ſift the houſe of Iſrael, like as corne is ſifted in a ſieve.</hi> 4. Albeit theſe who are elect, yea and actually converted, may go into captivity with others, that ſo the unconverted may be drawen thereby, as by other meanes, to ſeek him, and the converted may be ſifted and purged from droſſe; Yet God by none of his diſpenſations will loſe any even the meaneſt of them who are his elect, or of them who have really turned to him; for, <hi>yet ſhall not the leaſt grain fall upon the earth,</hi> or be loſt and periſh. The word in the Original, is <hi>a ſtone,</hi> and it may be the good grain gets this name from its weight, in oppoſition to the light chaffe. 5. The reaſon why the Lord will not ſuffer all Iſrael to be loſt in their diſperſion, is becauſe (whatever they were at their rejection, or be for preſent, yet) he hath many precious elect ones and heirs of glory to come out of their loins, and becauſe he will reſerve a ſeed of a glorious Church of that Nation: And this is the look we ſhould take of their ſubſiſtence under their deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late condition, and notwithſtanding their long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in blindneſſe and ignorance; for, ſo much alſo is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported here, as is before explained. 6. God is ſufficient
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:114928:271"/>
to ſecure intended mercies unto his people, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſes, in times of ſaddeſt ſhaking; for, he undertakes this for Iſrael, that hnwever he ſift and ſhake them, yet certainly he wil not loſe ſo much as the leaſt grain.</p>

It is the great and crying ſin of men within the viſible Church, that they are ſo deluded with conceit, or ſo beſotted and blinded with Atheiſme and cuſtome in ſin, that they will not believe Gods word, nor fear when he threatens: Therefore doth he declare who theſe eminent ſinners are whom he will cut off with the firſt, they <hi>ſay the evil ſhall not overtake nor prevent us,</hi> or ſurprize us, that is, either it ſhall never reach us nor we meet with it, or if it do, we ſhall do well enough, and be prepared to abide it. 4.

Or it points out that <hi>Davids</hi> family was but an obſcure Tabernacle till God raiſed it; and ſo it ſheweth, that Gods glorious appearing in the raiſing up thereof, would not hinder him to make it fall, when he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked. 2. Albeit the Lords breaking and ruining of his Church and people, be the juſt fruit of their ſin, and a ſad lot for preſent; yet the Lord thereby is but making way for their raiſing up again. This will ſtill hold true of his Church in general, however he diſpoſe of particular Churches, which he is provoked to deſtroy: And it will be made good to his Church of Iſrael, <hi>I will raiſe up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and cloſe up the breaches thereof, and I will raiſe up his ruines.</hi> The expreſſions are borrowed from mens repairing of a ruined houſe. 3. Chriſt is the repairer of his Churches ruines, and every loſſe is richly compenſed that is made up in him, and in things of the Goſpel; for, it is <hi>in that day</hi> of the Goſpel, and in and by Chriſt, that the Lord will do this, as is further cleared, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.16, 17. 4. The ſpiritual glory of the Goſpel-Church doth parallel any glorious eſtate of Iſrael of old; and the Church of Iſrael will be again advanced to as much glory (at leaſt ſpiritual) as ever they enjoyed; for, <hi>I will build it as in the dayes of old.</hi>

                     <p>The ſecond promiſe (which expounds in part the glory of his Church) is the enlargement of the bounds of the Church, by taking in Gentiles as well as Jewes into the fellowſhip thereof, who by profeſſing the name of God ſhall beare the badge of being his people. This indeed began to be accompliſhed when the Gentiles were brought in with the remnant of the Jewes, and filled the roome of
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:114928:272"/>
theſe who were blinded and hardened; And ſo <hi>James</hi> expounds it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.16, 17. But a more full accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be when Iſrael being converted, ſhall bring in many Nations, and even ſome of their ſubdued enemies (called h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>re <hi>Edom,</hi> who of old was one of the worſt) with them. As for the difference betwixt the words of this text, and <hi>James</hi> citation of them, (who in ſomewhat differs not onely from the Original text here, but even from the Greek Interpreters) we need not labour curiouſly in reconciling thereof. For, 1. Albeit this text be the chiefe place pointed at by <hi>James,</hi> yet ſince he cites not one Prophet, but <hi>the Prophets, Act.</hi> 15.15. it is ſufficient that what he ſaith doth accord with what is generally held out in the Prophets, albeit all of it be not found here. 2. Though this were the onely text cited by him, yet the general ſcope of both places agrees in one, which is to prove that the glory of the Goſpel-Church conſiſts in the acceſſion of other Nations, beſide the Jewes, unto it. And this was ſufficient to <hi>James</hi> preſent purpoſe, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme his opinion in the Council, albeit his citation, or the tranſlation which he followed, do differ from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> in ſome particulars of leſſe importance. 3. Though there be ſome other differences, yet not onely are both readings to be acknowledged by us as true, being uſed by the pen-men of the Spirit of God; But both come to one ſenſe and purpoſe, which is the thing that is ofttimes looked to in citations in the New Teſtament, rather then the words. For, whereas <hi>Amos</hi> hath it <hi>that they may poſſeſſe the remnant</hi> &amp;c. (or, as ſome read it, <hi>that the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant may poſſeſſe,</hi> to wit, the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> ſpoken of in the former <hi>v.</hi>) and <hi>James</hi> hath it, <hi>that the reſidue might ſeek after the Lord,</hi> the ſenſe is the ſame, in regard that they who embracing Iſraels Covenant, are, ſo to ſay, poſſeſſed by Iſrael as a purchaſe, and they who enjoy the priviledges of the Church, and God in it, muſt be ſeekers of God that they may poſſeſſe, and be kept in poſſeſſion. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Amos</hi> hath it, <hi>the remnant of Edom,</hi> beſide that general of <hi>the heathen,</hi> that he may point in particular, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of enemies, yet <hi>James</hi> doth not unfitly tranſlate it, <hi>the reſidue of men,</hi> not onely becauſe the Jewes did uſually by the name of <hi>Edom</hi> (the other ſon of Iſaac) point out the generality of mankinde without the Church, and who
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:114928:273"/>
were not of the race of Iſrael, but enemies thereunto, and ſo the following words, <hi>all the Gentiles,</hi> are but an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of that; but becauſe the text in <hi>Amos</hi> doth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points out that a remnant of other men then of the Jewes, ſhould be brought in to the Church, which <hi>James</hi> expreſſeth, leaving that particular conſideration of <hi>Edom,</hi> as nothing to his preſent purpoſe. <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. The cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and inbringing of the Gentiles is an eſpecial glory of the Goſpel-Church: and it will be the honour of Iſrael, that when they are converted, many Gentiles ſhall be brought in and joine with them; for, this is the end of raiſing up the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> and the glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>that they may poſſeſſe the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen.</hi> 2. As under the Goſpel all Nations have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto the Church, and to Chriſt in it: So in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it is a great mercy that even moſt bitter enemies may and will be brought in, eſpecially after the converſion of Iſrael; Therefore, beſide <hi>all the heathen,</hi> in general, <hi>Edom,</hi> who was Iſraels moſt bitter enemy (whereby we muſt underſtand others of the ſame kinde) is particularly named in this promiſe. 3. As they are but ſtill a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant who ſeek God in ſincerity; ſo it is no ſtrange thing to ſee a great deſtruction of Nations and enemies, before they will come in to God; for, this cauſe are they called <hi>the remnant of Edom, and of all the heathen,</hi> not onely becauſe it was but remnants of them who came in at firſt, and who then, and afterward when more profeſſed the Goſpel, did ſincerely turn to God; but eſpecially becauſe after the converſion of Iſrael, many of the Nations will oppoſe them, and they will be broken and puniſhed by God, and then the remnant of them, and others ſhall be converted. 4. As all who are true converts, and embrace Chriſt, do embrace and ſhare in Iſraels Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed; So Iſrael after their converſion, will be a very eminent and notable Church, whom many Nations ſhall honour, and to whom they ſhall joine themſelves: In both theſe reſpects it is true, that <hi>they</hi> (or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the old Tabernacle of <hi>David) ſhall poſſeſſe the remnant of Edom;</hi> for, all who are converted, are ingraffed into the ſame ſtock, and entered into the ſame Covenant with the Jewes, and ſo are a new acceſſion unto them; and Iſrael being converted, will bring in a great conqueſt and purchaſe to
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:114928:273"/>
the Lord, of theſe who ſhall be revived and quickened at their appearing on the ſtage, and who ſhall much honour the Church of Iſrael. 5. As all who are brought in to the Goſpel, are bound to make publick profeſſion of the name of God and Chriſt, and inrol themſelves as his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates and followers; So it is the great honour of a people, that they beare this badge and livery, and have a viſible right ſo to do: And this viſible right and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion doth warrant them to ſeek unto God (as it is <hi>Act.</hi> 15.17.) and gives them right to Church fellowſhip; for, it is they <hi>which are called by my name,</hi> or, <hi>upon whom my name is called,</hi> whom Iſrael <hi>ſhall poſſeſſe,</hi> and who ſhall poſſeſſe the Tabernacle of <hi>David,</hi> as Church-members. 6. As all this muſt be Gods work to bring it about, ſo his word is ſufficient ground of aſſurance, whereupon we may expect it, and his doing of it ſhould put an end to all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies about it, as in all other things, his working is to be ſubmitted unto; Therefore is all ſealed thus, <hi>ſaith the Lord who doth this,</hi> whereby he not onely gives his word and undertakes to effectuate it; but he owns the work of advancing the Gentiles, to ſilence all the quarrelling of the Jewes againſt it.</p>

                     <p>This third promiſe may be underſtood figurativly of many ſpiritual bleſſings pointed out under theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; But it is more cleare to underſtand it literally, as <hi>Joel</hi> 3.18. of great abundance of plenty, which as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time he hath beſtowed upon his Church, ſo he will give a ſpecial proofe of his care in this particular to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iſrael. The promiſe holds out the old bleſſing upon the land promiſed to Iſrael, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.4, 5. Wherein he promiſeth that the land ſhall be ſo fertile, that when they have ſcarce done with plowing, harveſt ſhall come, and then ſeed-time ſhall immediatly follow upon the vintage,
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:114928:274"/>
ſo that they ſhall be kept very throng with plowing, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and harveſt, in a manner all at once; And that they ſhould have abundance of wine, and the very hils ſhould as it were, melt down in bleſſings upon them. <hi>Whence learn,</hi> 1. Whatever be the quarrellings of the Lords people about their outward condition; Yet all that they uſually miſſe, and much more, is in Gods hand to give them, if they would ſeek better things in the firſt place, and if they would not be the worſe for receiving them; So much doth this ample promiſe import. 2. The Lord alſo can, when he ſeeth it meet, fit a people for enjoying theſe outward mercies, without abuſing of them; for, this promiſe imports that Iſrael may get them in mercy, and uſe them ſo, at leaſt for a time. For otherwiſe other Scriptures tell us, that at laſt after their converſion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity will be one of the laſt and great evils of the Church. 3. Whatever be the ordinary miſtakes of men about piety, yet it is great errour to think that piety is loſſe, and God will have this errour refuted; for, this promiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, that as the Lord hath ſometimes formerly proven that piety is profitable for all things, by ſome Sun-blenks of proſperity; So he will make Iſrael a notable proofe thereof.</p>

                     <p>The fourth and laſt promiſe doth more expresſly relate to Iſrael, wherein is declared, that however they were driven into captivity and ſcattered for ſin; Yet the Lord will gather them again and reſtore them, to build up the redeſolations, and enjoy the fruit of their labours, And he paſſeth his word, and giveth the Covenant in pledge, that
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:114928:274"/>
there ſhall be no other captivity of that Nation, to follow after that. So that it cannot be underſtood of Judah, and their captivity in Babylon, after which there followed another captivity; Nor can it well be taken onely ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, ſeeing ſo expreſſe mention is made of their <hi>waſte cities,</hi> and of <hi>the land which he hath given them. Doct.</hi> 1. Iſrael will not be loſt, nor miſſe to ſhare in Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and priviledges, notwithſtanding their ſin and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering for ſin; for, <hi>I will bring again the captivity of Iſrael.</hi> 2: Outward mercies are ſweet, eſpecially in ſo far as they are publick evidences of a peoples intereſt in God, as they are to the godly and his confederate people; for, this ſweetens the mercy, that they get it as <hi>my people of Iſrael.</hi> 3. When a people are brought in to Chriſt, and he begins to ſhine upon them, they may expect that he will repair and make up their deſolations and wants; for, <hi>they ſhall build the waſte cities, and inhabit them.</hi> 4. As it is juſt with God to diſappoint impenitent ſinners of all their labours and expectations; So a penitent people may expect Gods bleſſing upon their labours, and to reap the fruits thereof; for, of this Iſrael is an inſtance, <hi>they ſhall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they ſhall alſo make gardens, and eat the fruit thereof.</hi> 5. God can not onely reſtore his people, but eſtabliſh them in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward condition, when he pleaſeth; And in particular, the ſtate of Iſrael after their converſion, will be ſettled and not interrupted with ſuch ſhakings as formerly; for, <hi>I will plant them upon their land, and they ſhall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them.</hi> 6. Gods faithfulneſſe in his promiſe, and his conſtancy in keeping Covenant with his people, may and ſhould aſſure them of the certainty of what ſeemeth moſt impoſſible and incredible; Therefore doth he ſeal all with this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, <hi>ſaith the Lord thy God.</hi> Where <hi>Jehovahs</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, is ſufficient to aſſure them he will do it, <hi>Num.</hi> 23.19. And his deſigning himſelfe, <hi>thy God,</hi> doth not onely aſſure them that the Covenant ſhould not be made utterly void, notwithſtanding their long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; But that as his being <hi>Abrahams</hi> God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth there ſhall be a reſurrection, and that even <hi>Abrahams</hi> duſt ſhall not be loſt, <hi>Math.</hi> 22.32.

<pb n="534" facs="tcp:114928:275"/>
